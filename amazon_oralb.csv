0,Get the Pro 1500 instead.,3,"Update #2: I know the Pro 1500 isn't on Oral-B's website. When I bought the Pro 1500 nearly a year ago, I asked Oral-B why it's not on their site because I was concerned I had just bought a discontinued product. They assured me that it was in fact a brand new item that they had just released and that they were going to add the Pro 1500 to their site ""soon"".

I realize that it's nearly a year later and they still haven't done it even though they are still manufacturing it, but I have been to their site several times per month since then and I can tell you that I'm honestly not surprised it's not on their site yet. I get the impression that anyone could do a better job with their site up-keep than whoever is doing it now. I have even noticed that it's kinda somewhat falling apart. Some elements no longer work and haven't worked for months. Their products are fine, they just need better people to handle and operate their website.

Update #1: When I wrote this review, the price was the same for the Pro 1000 and Pro 1500 (including both the black and white Pro 1000s). Today, the price for the Pro 1500 nearly $20 more than it was when I wrote this review, and currently close to $30 more than the Pro 1000.

[Original review below]
I bought this to replace a very new Vitality. It was a *HUGE* upgrade over the Vitality, but then I saw the Pro 1500 and learned from Oral-B that it's quite superior. The Pro 1000's specs are:

- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean
- 8,800 oscillations per minute and 20,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode
- A pressure sensor that's supposed to just stop the pulsations when it's triggered
- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes
- A NiMH battery (old technology)
- A battery life of 28 minutes (7 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)
- A full recharge time of 22 hours
- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging
- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged
- The CrossAction brush head

The Pro 1500's specs are:

- 2 cleaning modes: Daily Clean and Sensitive
- 9,900 oscillations per minute and 45,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode (these speeds are faster than any I've seen so far in the specs of any of Oral-B's electric toothbrushes, including the Genius 8000 - they all seem to top out at 8,800 oscillations per minute and 40,000 pulsations per minute)
- 7,400 oscillations per minute and 33,000 pulsations per minute on the Sensitive mode
- A pressure sensor using a red LED that turns on when the pressure sensor is triggered
- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes
- A Lithium Ion battery
- A battery life of 56 minutes (14 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)
- A full recharge time of 12 hours
- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging
- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged.
- The CrossAction brush head

The Vitality is extremely basic:

- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean
- 7,600 oscillations per minute.
- A timer that hesitates the motor 3 times every 2 minutes
- A NiMH battery
- A battery life of 20 minutes (5 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)
- A full recharge time of 19 hours
- No charge indicators or battery life indicators
- Mine came with the Sensitive Gum Care brush head

In comparison, the Vitality seems like a cheap generic electric toothbrush. Don't consider buying it.

When I upgraded to the Pro 1000, it was amazing. I wanted to burst at the seams and write an extremely rave review, but then I learned about *and ordered* the Oral-B Pro 1500. After using it, I can tell you that the Pro 1500 is *FAR* better than the Pro 1000. I honestly feel the Pro 1000 should be discontinued and no one should ever buy it. I mean really, the Pro 1500 is only $10 more right now and it destroys the Pro 1000.

I would have given the Pro 1000 4 stars instead of just 3 if it had a Lithium Ion battery. They charge faster and last longer without charging.

So yeah, I am not sure I would recommend the Pro 1000 if you can get the Pro 1500. The Pro 1500 is a much wiser purchase. I'm *extremely* happy with mine. It blows the Pro 1000 out of the water.",833
1,ITS SO LOUD,1," I bought this because I left my sonic care at my overseas after a trip. I thought it was supposed to be awesome and ready for a change.

6,Very loud & poor battery life,3,"I've had a Sonic Care for many years and it finally died. My dentist recommended an Oral-B instead, so I thought sure, I'll get one. The price is much cheaper for the brush and the heads for the Oral-B than for the super expensive Sonic Care. But all I can say is - I got what a paid for. This toothbrush is so LOUD. I was not prepared for that. It sounds like the motor is laboring to move all of the brushes. The battery life is awful on this one. I've got to plug it in every few days for about 30 hours to get a full charge. I never had to do this with my last one.

I do like that the brush heads are inexpensive, they go on easily, and can interchange with other brushes in the series (might try a more expensive one in the line). I have slightly crooked teeth on the bottom and this toothbrush is doing a much better job cleaning those teeth than my old Sonic Care did.",176
7,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!,1,this product is HORRIBLE. We used it for one charge and then have NOT been able to get it to recharge!

I had a protection plan on it, so I contacted them about getting a new one, but no one ever responded to my claim.

20,I like the 4 part timer as well,4,"I had an oral-B that lasted for a very long time but using this one made me realize how weak the old battery had gotten. I like the 4 part timer as well. It does 2 or 3 short pulse pauses, basically, you divide your mouth into upper left, lower left, upper right and lower right side and brush each part till the dzhut dzhut pulse, then go to the next part. When you have done all 4 areas it has 3 or 4 longer pause pulses to let you know you're done. Having it split this way encourages me to brush the full time rather than cutting it a little short if its only a single length timer.

I have noticed that if I leave the brush head on it and just stick it back on the charging base there is always a little toothpaste still in the housing for the brush that will run down the handle and leave that white toothpaste film but if I remove the brush head and keep it somewhere else I don't have that problem.",182
21,This toothbrush packs a punch and my teeth feel super clean!,5,"This toothbrush by Oral-B is so much better than my previous Sonic toothbrush, I am more than pleased with how well it works. After my previous toothbrush stopped working, I searched on Amazon for a new one. Luckily, I came across this toothbrush and I really liked that it was not complicated to use, just an on and off button. I did look at the other Oral-B toothbrushes and it amazed me how sophisticated they were and that they even came with a phone App to help you with brushing your teeth. I really did not need all the bells and whistles and that is what is offered with this model. Not to mention the black and white color which is my favorite.

The Oral-B Pro 1000 comes with a charging station and brush. This toothbrush packs a punch and my teeth feel super clean. The head of the brush is small and round and the bristles really make a difference when it comes to cleaning my teeth. The body of the toothbrush has a good grip with grooves that are built in around the handle. I like this so not only do I hold it better, I am not dropping it easily when brushing my teeth. There is a charging station where the toothbrush is stored and it does plug into a socket. The charger works well and I have not had a problem with losing any power when I brush my teeth. It looks great on my bathroom sink which is where it is kept when not in use.

I will say that I prefer this electric toothbrush over a sonic and am glad that I made the switch. This brush cleans my teeth, gums and tongue much better than the other one ever did. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend this toothbrush to others for sure.",311
22,Loud!!! Sounds like a jackhammer,1,I just received this electric toothbrush yesterday and it sounds like a jackhammer! Anyone else astounded at the noice it makes? It woke up the whole family with its loud motor! I’ve had electric toothbrushes for decades and never one that made this kind of noise.,46
23,Basic brush done right,5,"Wanted something basic that would get the job done. No fancy bells or whistles unless you count it's 30second timers which was just what I wanted.

Got to replace my old Braun toothbrush. This one has a lot more vigor to it. My old one was great but the new ones feels just like that, a new version of a good older product.",63
24,Awesome but...,4,Cleans great but those replacement heads are SO expensive!!!,9
25,SUPER LOUD! Poor battery life!,1,"I've been using Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for nearly 15 years. I got tired of spending so much for replacement heads. One day, I was in Rite-Aid and saw their store brand electric toothbrush for only $9. Electric toothbrush technology has improved so much over the years, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was pretty underwhelmed. It was so loud. My teeth didn't feel nearly as clean as they do after using a Sonicare.

I came across a lighting deal for the Oral-B Pro while browsing Amazon. I had high hopes for this toothbrush since Oral-B is a direct competitor to Sonicare. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS SO LOUD! My bathroom is right next to my daughters room. I literally can not use this toothbrush at night because it wakes her up! My teeth don’t feel as clean as they did with the Sonicare either. The battery life is terrible as well. The Sonicare would go months between charges whereas this one lasts a week if that. The $9 Rite-Aid brand toothbrush works just as well as the Oral-B Pro and is significantly cheaper.

There are only two things I like about the Oral-B vs the Sonicare. The Oral-B is very compact and travel friendly. It’s closer to the size of a regular toothbrush whereas the Sonicare is massive and a pain to pack. Aesthetically, the Oral-B is a much nicer looking toothbrush.

After coming from the Phillips Sonicare, I cannot recommend this toothbrush. The Sonicare does take some getting use too. The sonic vibrations create a weird sensation in your mouth.

I retired my Oral-B to a drawer and ended up buying a no-name brand Sonic toothbrush. It’s almost identical to the $250 Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean but cost less than $40. I’ve had it almost a month and I love it. Here’s the link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MBNMFSL/",313
26,Works as well as more expensive models if you don’t need all the other features.,4,"If you don’t need all the bells and whistles, this is the toothbrush to get. I’ve had 2 other electric toothbrushes in the past - a Sonicare 4300 and an Oral B Pro 5000. I know it’s a personal preference, but didn’t like the Sonicare at all. The Oral B was great, and the battery lasted about 1.5 yrs before it stopped consistently holding a charge. Honestly though, I never used most of the features of the 5000, including WiFi. This basic 1000 model has the only 2 attributes I really need: a timer and a sensor when you’re brushing too hard. For the price point, I’m sorry that I bought the pricier models first!

Update 12/14/19:

The one thing that I do miss about the more expensive 5000 model is the longer-lasting battery life. I was able to use the Pro 5000 for roughly 10-14 days off of a full charge; with this 1000 model, I have to charge every 5-7 days. If I traveled with this toothbrush, it might be a bigger inconvenience. Overall, I still think this is a great option for the price range.",188
27,"great choice, don't spend more on a toothbrush",5,"I'm very happy with this electric toothbrush and my dental hygienist is quite pleased with the results. During my last cleaning, I had no bleeding from my gums because of the extra cleaning from this Oral-B.

Battery life is amazing- I only have to charge it about once per month.

I only use this once per day but it can easily get behind my wisdom teeth. It can also get into other tight spaces in my mouth and get all the way to the gum line.

My wife has a fancier Oral-B with a bunch of different modes and a wireless feature that tells when you're done: this toothbrush is superior as far as I'm concerned. Her battery only lasts about a week and the wireless features seem to be a gimmick at best. Save your money and get this one.",141
28,Excellent electric toothbrush for a decent price,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a powered toothbrush. It was not costly, holds a charge well, and has 30 second increments indicated when using the brush. It does not come with a case or anything but I have not really needed one. I just put it in my travel bag and it does fine.

This set just comes with the brush and the charger. Nothing else is supplied. If you need new heads you will have to purchase those in addition.

Dimensions can be seen in the photos I have attached.

Pros:
*Holds a charge well
*30 second increments
*Soft bristles
*Inexpensive

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
More heads and maybe a case may be worth while if you are doing a bit of traveling.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

29,Modern,4,"The biggest ADVANTAGE I see - compared to the Philips Sonicare - is this:

Sonicare comes with two encasements to scroll the brush part to the motor. It always gets fungus black yuck into it. THIS ORAL B has none of it. Just a stick!

Push it in and then put to charge (Or just charge without brush). The charger HOLDS the brush! If you move the Philips Sonicare charger, the brush/motor FALLS OUT! Not this one, NOT EVEN if you turn it up side down if you push it in the right direction.

Although, it takes like FOREVER to fully charge it, you may use it after minutes of charging. Yet: YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT LEVEL IT IS CHARGED (like in oral b Genius 8000).

READ THE INSTRUCTIONS:

At first I thought the MOTOR was weak. No: they name it PRESSURE SENSOR to “protect your gums” not too hard to push. Or maybe it’s the “every-30-second-turn-the-power-low NOT TO DISTURB YOU - which they have!! - but to tell you “you-just-brushed-30-seconds!)

Well, negro - black is nice. Smaller than Philips Sonicare and definitely EASIER to put together. One click!

The handle is not all black like the black version of oral b Genius 8000. This is slightly slimmer and shorter than the oral b Genius 8000. (SEE PHOTOS BELOW)

The motor of this oral b PRO 1000 is STRONGER than the oral b Genius 8000 in any function.

I bless you: use ANY BRUSH HEAD ON THIS ONE regardless this has not the “vibrating functions” other highly EXPENSIVE oral b versions like the oral b Genius 8000 has build in. I TRULY SEE IT DOESNT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!

Why purchase oral b Genius 8000:

Play with it. Use the app Bluetooth required or SKIP it. It has a travel case not just the ones for ANY oral b, but may be adjusted as CHARGER while you plug in a cable.",321
30,Battery life main issue.,1,"Great at first, but after 4 months of using multiple times a day, the battery requires charging every other day. I only charge the device once the battery blinks red and I charge it for maybe 8 hours so I'm not over charging it and it will still die within a week. Left it on the charger over a weekend while out of town and didn't fix the issue either.",70
31,Can not go back to a normal brush,5,"I was always hesitant to switch over to an electric brush, for reasons unknown, I guess I never thought they were any different than brushing by hand.

I tried not to do it, but I was sometimes a bit of a hard brusher. I heard more and more that that was not good. Then I heard that you should brush away from the gums. That was slow work. I had also often heard that an electric toothbrush was the way to go. So I finally bought one, and I am very glad I did.

My teeth feel cleaner after each brushing, very much so. And one thing I really like is that the brush stops if there is too much pressure being applied to the teeth. So I just lighten up the pressure a little, and the brush gets right back to work.

The electric toothbrush is less cumbersome than a regular toothbrush, so it really gets to the back teeth, getting all the corners of the molars. I read someone saying it was like a jackhammer in the mouth, and I don't feel that way at all. It is not very noisy at all (this coming from someone who is sensitive to noise).

Before with a regular toothbrush, I don't think I often reached the 1-minute mark for my brushing, but now it is easy to reach the 2-minute mark that is recommended.

I highly recommend this electric toothbrush. It gets all the corners and crevices, it is easy, and it is thorough. My teeth are getting even cleaner, and it feels wonderful.",264
32,Garbage: Purposely Engineered To Fail,1,"This piece of junk lasted 13 months. MANY reviewers here have correctly blasted the woefully short battery life of Braun’s electric toothbrushes. This is no accident. They quit charging after a ridiculously short period of time, thus proving their toothbrush line the very antithesis of “green.” Unless you are an experienced solderer and follow the many videos you'll find on youTube there’s no way to outsmart Braun’s grifting company culture, which extends to its other products as well—but I’ll stay focused on their electric toothbrush for now. The large number of how-to-fix videos on youTube reveals just how common and widespread Braun’s con game is. Braun decided to build obsolescence into this item, one guesses thinking we’ll just go out and buy another crappy Braun. Not only is there is no reason a replaceable battery cannot be engineered into this design, but the option they have chosen is actually more costly and complicated to produce in their quest to rip off their customer and to support the expansion of landfills everywhere. I hope buyers will move on to other brands in protest—money talks when consumers walk.",186
33,Worth it.,4,"I don’t normally do reviews but..
This was an impulse buy after being locked in my house for a quarantine period due to contracting the well known virus.. so I purchased this for no reason other than to buy myself something and my girlfriend can’t get mad for me purchasing a toothbrush. Well the box comes with only 1 toothbrush head for it which is as advertised. Cool little charger comes too. The black and white color is not exactly cute but it does feel good in your hand. I’ve never used an electric toothbrush and I’m almost 30 years old so I was super thrown off by the experience. I had the debated to buy the 1500 one but opted for this one because of the price difference. So I immediately go to brush my teeth because after being locked in for 10 days I acted like a child at christmas. I can’t even imagine how powerful the 1500 is because my teeth have never felt so clean in my life. I’ve brushed my teeth 4 times since it was delivered earlier today. It’s not a quiet machine but it’s not obnoxious or anything. It took me a solid bit to figure out why it was pulsing but I realized it was a timer for 30 second intervals. Also pretty cool. I know nothing of the Bluetooth connectivity. You will need to charge it upon arrival. It’s charged some but not fully I was able to brush my teeth but after is was flashing red. Overall I’m super pleased with my random purchase and will report back if it ends up sucking later down the road.",277
34,"I bought this toothbrush in October and it works fine, however",3,"I bought this toothbrush in October and it works fine, however, the metal piece started rusting. I'm incredibly disappointed as this toothbrush suppose to be working for years and not only a few months. Feels like waste of money, I guess I should've went with Sonicare.",46
35,Incorrect battery description,2,"Description of item states polymer battery but it’s not also only handle and brush are made in Germany where is battery made? I charged it for 12hrs but it stopped working in less then one minute?! Then charged it for 24hrs and it worked last night for 2 minutes but when pressed again to go longer battery showed red flash to recharge? So do you have to continuously keep it on charger? Have been using oral b brushes for 15yrs my last one the 1500 lasted 6yrs, was going to return this new one model 1000 but the price of the 1500 is absurd! Even the 1000 is way over priced, started return but will see how it does for a few days, before investing $70 for the 1500!
New review now that I been using it for more then a week. It started working better and for 5 days before it shut itself off and I couldn’t restart it even after waiting a few minutes the red battery light never came on so I left it charging for 24 hours and think that’s what I should have done vs the 12 hrs, today it didn’t stop but red battery light came on for the first time, maybe it gets better with time, I’m going to keep using it and see what happens in these next few days, don’t see much difference over the 1500 model it pulses the same for each quadrant, the 1500 lasted me about 6 years but it was less expensive then the 1000 is now, prices are ridiculously high everywhere for everything!
Not sure what model to replace this one with, it only worked for several days fully charged once, now it’s not working more then 2 days without charging and it’s stopping before 2 minutes and won’t restart when I press button, have to finish brushing with a manual brush and put this 1000 back on charger even when red light isn’t on! Want to stay with oral B as I have been using this brand for so many years but all descriptions of the models available don’t sound so positive and I have experienced a few times the brush part bitting the inner lower part of my lip as mentioned by another review, weird sensation it pulls the skin like a bee sting, I have sensitive gums but want to brush without a timer that shuts it down, I’m old enough to know how long to brush and where as per dentist not per manufacturer
Maybe someone or manufacturer can give me some suggestions, not happy with this 1000 model but don’t want to spend so much for a brush that now won’t last me as long as my previous one.",458
36,Buy this now,5,"It took 5 dentists and thousands of dollars spent, and countless hours wasted, before I finally found a dentist that recommends electric toothbrush. I was always OCD when it comes to flossing and brushing teeth, but I would still get cavities. Never could figure out why. Dentists always just told me, oh it's just genetics, oh you just need to brush better. Then I tried this Oral-B electric toothbrush.

I got this because my dentist recommends the one with round head, says it brushes like the tools they use in the dental office. First time visiting my hygienist after using electric toothbrush, she said ""WOW I can't find anything to clean!"". I've now gone 3+ years now without a single cavity, no tooth ache, no more gum issues, nothing. The only thing I've changed in my routine is I'm using this electric toothbrush instead.

Looking back, it's honestly too sad that none of my prior dentists would even mention electric toothbrush. Now I know why. If more people use electric toothbrush, they would have less cavities to drill, and they wouldn't make as much money because their whole business relies on people having bad teeth. Shame on them I say, and bless to the one dentist (whom I'm still with today) that recommended me this electric toothbrush.

Don't wait, don't debate, just get this and you will get dentist-level clean every day. You will save thousands of dollars and hours upon hours of visiting dental offices. Not to mention less needles. Oh and if you're someone who has had lots of cavity and gum issues, and your dentist has not recommended electric toothbrush once? Dump them, find someone else. I'm serious, this is life changing, I wish more people understands how good electric toothbrush can clean your teeth.

Yes, you will need to buy replacement brush heads, it's added expense for sure. But remember, crowns cost $500-$600 each. Save yourself from getting poked by needles and wasting hours at the dental office. Take control of your life and feel better with a good smile.",344
37,Sorry I made the switch from Sonicare!,3,"I did a little research and the Oral B kept coming up as the better performing electric toothbrush. However for me, I wish that I had bought another Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I find my new Oral B to be flimsy. I'm not brushing any harder then I ever have before and the motor stop feature kicks in frequently. I also find it messy. That is I have a harder time keeping the liquid toothpaste and saliva mud in my mouth. I'm not sure why that is but it is a slight problem for me. I have to rinse and dry the toothbrush every time I brush. Oral B doesn't provide any cap for the brush head while it's charging so it's exposed to whatever is in the air. I'll use up the heads that I've bought and re-evaluate then to make my keep or switch decision. Oh, well, live and learn. All be it, costly and time consuming.",158
38,"Do not buy, black color bleeds!",1,"I bought this toothbrush specifically because I wanted to make it even easier to distinguish between multiple brushes on the counter. Yes, I am aware that I could have gotten the tiny rubber rings to make the brushes 'different' but we are dealing with one of the brush owners being a child and a boy under 10 at that, so the attention to details is by default minimal to non-existent. So I thought: the WHOLE brush in different color will be perfect.

I was very disappointed to see that the black parts bleed the color A LOT - not only does the base look filthy as a result (something I don't need in my bathroom, thank you very much) but it also drips dark grey water in the sink as you brush. The picture shows the base after about 15 mins after brushing, not something that would build slowly over several days.

I find the functionality less than optimal, too, with loud noise and clunky motion. The previous Braun we got from Costco (white) was technically the same series and yet it performs much better.
I would not recommend this product unless you enjoy watching the black drops drip in the sink.",202
39,This thing is disgusting! DO NOT PURCHASE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!,1,"I picked this up hoping it would clean a bit better than the cheap Orbal-B electric I picked up at Walmart for about $20.

Oh my GOD. Please do not buy this! I don’t know what they made the handle out of, but unless you want to disassemble your toothbrush everyday and risk soaking a battery in water, do not get this. I don’t know what tf is wrong with it. It STINKS! It’s something about the material. This will smell like wet dog and dirty socks on day 2. I tried taking it apart every day and disinfecting it but it still smelled absolutely disgusting no matter what I did. I can’t even get it to stop stinking to high hell long enough to charge it all the way.

This is an absolute no-brainer of a return. What were you thinking Oral-B?!? Disgusting, awful product! Do. Not. Buy. I’m so glad I didn’t throw away my old electric toothbrush.

It doesn’t matter if you soak it in listerine, use disinfecting wipes, bleach, or use a denture tablet soak. It smells terrible and the smell will cover your hands. I was prompted to write this review because I was too disgusted to even wash my face with the same hands that touched the toothbrush, so I contacted support to return it. Thank goodness for Amazon’s return policy!

Unless you love the smell of ACTUAL DEATH, avoid at all costs. I picked up the cheap version of the oral b electric awhile ago and the handle grip was light blue instead of black. Find it. Cherish it. Keep it. Run far, far away from this. I never write reviews, but this was terrible enough to deserve one. If I could give it zero stars, I would.",295
40,Not for those with small mouths,2,"After researching toothbrushes for an embarrassing amount of time, I purchased this brush because it was recommended as a good, basic budget brush. After using it a four or five times, I am unimpressed. This is no different than the $5 battery-operated models. It has no features, besides off/on and stopping when there is too much pressure. No timer ever was present; the ""brush modes"" do not exist on this model; and after a day and a half of charging, it still isn't fully charged. What's confusing is that the user manual says these features are on the model. It wasn't until I looked into reviews that I learned the manual is a ""one-size-fits-all"" one Oral-B uses for all its models.
The thing that is mostly influencing a return of this item is that the brush head is large and clunky, and difficult to fit into and use in tight spaces. I am a petite person, with a small mouth; it was very difficult to get this around my back molars. I didn't feel like the result was as clean as my former Sonicare brush, which does have a smaller head. Also, the brush head vibrates like crazy and the brush is pretty hard. If I could get this back in the area, it was pretty rough brushing, or the tight fit triggered the pressure sensor to turn the brush off. All in all, this just didn't work for me.",240
41,"Good brush, but be careful cleaning it!",2,"I was really hoping for a rotating brush head, but apparently it just rotates a few degrees back and forth (oscillates, as it says, which I missed reading). I didn't get a chance to use it much because I killed mine, so here's a basic review of what happened and what you should not do. All in all, it gets the job done.

I made the mistake of rinsing the whole thing, which you should definitely not do. I ruined mine and now it doesn't work at all, after sputtering to life for a while. When cleaning, take the brush head off and rinse as you see fit, but make sure you let it dry before re-attaching it. The metal prong where it attaches isn't sealed well at the opening in the base where it protrudes from, allowing water to seep through into the internal components. If you need to clean the base, use a damp cloth and wipe.

Also, that little blue plastic ring that comes with it is meant to click into place at the base of the brush head, not just sit below. Something else I missed. Probably was partially responsible for water getting through and killing mine.

And FYI, I looked up the repair possibility. The location where repairs are done claims costs for repairs for most items is $30 to $50, which makes it pointless since the brush costs about that much, and you have to pay to ship it to them as well.

Update: I was shopping for another electric toothbrush, and noticed that this one claims to have a waterproof handle. This is not true, be careful.",274
42,The Best Choice Toothbrush!,5,"I had an expensive (about $120 when new) Oral-B electric toothbrush that worked for many years (at least 5, maybe even 10 years), but I left it behind in a hotel room. I had a cheaper toothbrush (I think it was also Oral-B) for the shower that used disposable batteries. It stopped working about the same time. I bought two of these (Oral-B 1000 CrossAction) to replace both of my old brushes. One is for the sink, one for the shower, and I plan switch them when the battery dies on the one in the shower (it has been about a month and it has not died yet).

The Oral-B 1000 CrossAction is very solidly constructed. The quality feels about the same as my old expensive brush and much better than the cheaper one. The brush action is actually even better than the old expensive one and far better than the cheaper one.

I don't see any reason to spend more. This is the best choice!",166
43,Buy another brand! This is TERRIBLE!!,1,"Loud, noisy, clumsy and NOT worth the 40$ it’s like a spinbrush you can buy at Walmart for 10$!
Terrible! Don’t waster your money. The so called smaller head isn’t that small and feels awkward and big in the mouth as it spins slow and strangely. I charged it up until the ligh flashed ready. It took about 12 hours because it was completely dead.",65
44,Good but not great,4,"This is my third electric toothbrush that I bought based off of reviews and best toothbrush guides. My first was a Sonic Care that worked well for a while but I decided to upgrade. The second one I got was an Aquasonic that was highly reviewed here on Amazon and after barely a year the battery doesn't hold enough charge and the vibration is very weak.
I was immediately unexcited after the first time I brushed with this toothbrush. Unlike the others I've owned that made my teeth feel incredibly clean, this one didn't leave my teeth with that extraordinary clean feeling. The thing I hate the most about it is that it doesn't beep every 30 seconds like the others. It simply does a small pause in vibration, and at the end of the two minutes it does a couple vibrations in a row but keeps going. I find it very easy to get distracted and miss the end vibration, leaving me wondering if I should keep brushing or not. The thing I do like about this toothbrush as opposed to the others is the round head, I feel it gets behind my molars better and I'm between the teeth better.",202
45,Deceptive marketing,2,"I bought this toothbrush for my wife, who has no complaints. I paid only about $40 for it. Except for color, it appears identical to another, more expensive model I bought earlier. My complaint with Oral B, or Braun, is that different models vary in price by up to hundreds of dollars, but if there is a functional difference, I can't find it. Speeds and motion seem to be the same, and replacement heads are interchangeable among most, if not all, models. Any mechanical differences seem to be trivial and irrelevant, such as ""programs"" that are only variations on a simple time. I guess the the company is entitled to charge more for different boxes and colors, and maybe a few more heads, but the verbiage implies superiority that doesn't seem to exist. If I am missing something, I wish the manufacturer would tell me where I went wrong. If there truly is a superior model, I would like to know about it and might be willing to shell out more money to try it.",175
46,"Excellent, i recommend this toothbrush over any other",5,"I love this toothbrush. I'm amazed how much better an electric toothbrush is at cleaning. I bought this because my dentist said i brush ""too aggressively"" and that an electric toothbrush would help, just let it do the brushing while moving it around.

Within a week my teeth were noticeably whiter and feel so much cleaner. It really polishes your teeth and cleans like getting a professional clean at the dentist. I can't believe i didn't get one sooner, i will never be without one now.

Also, the brush stays charged for a long time, at least a few weeks without having to charge it. The built in timer that vibrates every 30 seconds to tell you to move spots is really convenient, i didn't think i would like it but i do.",133
47,Great!,5,My teeth have been through some pretty rough times. I am a heavy coffee and wine drinker. I love this products. In one use I already feel a huge difference from using a standard brush. My teeth feel as clean as getting it done by the dentist. I will give it a try with some strong whitening toothpaste to see if I noticed a difference.,65
48,Nice toothbrush to have.,5,I really like it and does very good job to clean.,11
49,Oral B versus Sonicare,5,"I had been a loyal user of the Sonicare products for years, so long I cant tell you how many. Unfortunately I had two of them crap out on me relatively close together so I figured Id give this Oral B a try and see if they lasted longer. I bought one, with only one brush head just in case I didnt like it. After a couple of months now the Oral B is a far superior cleaning product, for me at least. I had two trouble areas that required extra cleaning by focused flossing and plaque removal. Since I have switched, the one area I need to focus on with flossing is no longer an issue and the one area where I needed to watch for plaque has gotten much much better. For me at least, the Oral B is a much better cleaner. The timer is also more pronounced which is an added plus. The only negative is the brush doesn't seem to seal as well with the lips so theres a bit more leakage. Thats probably more than anyone needs to hear but it is a very insignificant issue.",192
50,"I'll be honest I hate it, but it gets the job done.",3,"My previous electric toothbrush was a $30 Sonicare toothbrush I got from Walmart, but I left it at my parents house and took it as a sign that I should just buy another toothbrush and have one for my parent's house as well. This is the toothbrush that I will be comparing it to, not on any peer to peer level but it was the only other electric toothbrush I've owned as an adult.

I bought this one because I felt like the moving brush head would get me a better clean than the Sonicare. I hate it, it feels cheaper than the Sonicare did, and I have yet to not have toothpaste/siliva go down my chin a problem I have never had with a different toothbrush. it is obscenely loud. It has left my gums sore at points, another problem that I have never experienced. I had to brush my teeth LESS because my guns were getting raw. Which is quite counterintuitive.

At first it would vibrate every 30 seconds, that has since stopped, I timed it it comes every 45seconds to 1 minute, which screams defective but I cannot be bothered, I'd rather time myself.

If I had the option I would return. however, just like many reviews, I trashed the box. Maybe more expensive models are less awful, but at this point I just want to buy a new Sonicare.",233
51,Mold in the brush head?,3,"I've had this product for months now. I've replaced the brush head twice. For some reason, the smell is awful! It's as though there is moldy residue accumulating inside the brush head. I've tried drying it out separately, washing thoroughly after each use...I don't know what the deal is. But, it's pretty gross. Brush heads should be replaced every 3 months or if the bristles are worn down and/or there is clear discoloration of the blue bristles. So, I'm not really sure what the problem is or how to get rid of the mold? or smell? Otherwise, I like the product. Heads up, it is a very noisy device! Not silent like the Prosonic devices",115
52,Stick to Sonicare,1,"I was trying to find a different brand besides Sonicare after my 4 year old toothbrush broke. I tried this one but didn't like it. The biggest issue is that the toothbrush heads are too big and awkward. They are not designed like the heads of normal toothbrushes, so for anyone that has TMD and cannot open their mouth too wide, this one will cause discomfort and pain sometimes because you have to open your mouth too wide. The toothbrush heads also have a small tiny opening where water seeps in. It requires extra cleaning more than the usual cleaning I had to do with my previous Sonicare. In the end, I went back to Sonicare as they are more TMD friendly in design.",124
53,Good toothbrush let down by terrible handle,3,"I've had quite a few Oral B's over 15 years. I love my electric toothbrush as it's just a much much more thorough clean. I don't go for the bluetooth bells and whistles as frankly, they are just an excuse to charge more for unnecessary features. This version is good except for one thing - the shrink wrap on the handle. It looks cheap and feels cheap, but more importantly, it's very smooth so when it gets wet (which it will - it's a toothbrush) it's really hard to keep hold of. It just slides around in your hand. Ridiculous. I can't believe the boffins at Oral B thought this was a good idea. It's not even the cheapest brush in the range so this can't have been a cost cutting measure. It's just really bad user design. Like no one ever tested this in the real world. The version this replaced (the 1000 I think) had pale blue grippy rubber on the handle, which came off after 3 years hence the replacement. But it has much better functionality than this. I thought it looked a bit cooler, more designed, but I was wrong.",194
54,What a waste!,1,"I’m probably overly critical of consumer products in general these days as they all seem designed for the landfills. So take this for what it’s worth…

The battery eventually died on my old one that was identical to my wife’s (pictured between mine and my daughter’s here). I have an 8 year old who was super excited to get a “grown up” toothbrush, so I got her the kid version of ours. Then, since she and my wife both have white ones, I simply wanted a black version of the same toothbrush. Cause… well I just like black! And why not match my suite of Manscaping tools!

Turns out, that was more complicated than I thought. This brush was my third black toothbrush from this company trying to find one that wasn’t just slippery plastic (the other models didn’t have the nice rubber grip). Though I had many recommendations in favor of other brands, I wanted us all to be able to use the same charger.

This toothbrush is fatter than my old one, so it doesn’t feel as nice to hold. It shows white residue all over it no matter how much I rinse and clean it. I’m a shower brusher, so you’d think it would be easy to rinse (See aforementioned Manscaped products that are designed very well).

In addition, it turns out they don’t have the same brush tip choices in black either. So yeah… black was a fail!

Lastly… I’m not sure what device-dependent world makes anyone “need” an app to brush their teeth, but hey, I gave it a shot. Not convinced AT ALL that any of these modes are doing anything different for my teeth except maybe the gentler mode for the gums. But the app didn’t accurately pick up areas that I was brushing and requires you to actually grab your phone and turn the app on to utilize its features. With no plans to jump out of the shower or start my app before I get in… this is pretty useless.

Overall this is an overpriced gimmick for those who really just want everything they use to feel high tech!

K.I.S.S.
Keep Is Simple Stupid! :-)",364
55,"Overall good product, downside too loud.",4,"I really like my electric tooth brush though it is noisy. I feel it wakes my wife up in the early hours. I have owned my for a month now and so far it works efficiently. I was a lil’ afraid it would stop working on me based on a review or two and decided to purchase the extended warranty for $4 for 3 years. After brushing i remove the head or brush dry it and store it in a convenient place. Some reviews mentioned there were issues with tip build up or something to that effect. I thought this might address that issue. I also purchase additional sensitive brushes and alternate at my description. The one it comes with is a lil’ firm, good for plaque removal, doesn’t hurt my gums but I’m more comfortable with a sensitive brush. I bought another brands brushes, works brilliantly and far cheaper, great reviews! The brand is Better Choi, I believe it was something like 6 or 8 brushes for $13. Totally worth it. I belief this model had a timer, I could be wrong , doubting myself b/c it never worked. I don’t mind as I brush for about 3 min. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase and recommend to all. It could be much quieter though. Make sure to buy brushes separately, Better Choi, don’t laugh.",227
56,Bang for your buck / Great warranty,5,I have had this toothbrush for about 8 or 9 months. Immediately I could tell a difference after changing from a manual brush. I love the timer feature. It took me a few brushes to find a rhythm. I don’t charge my toothbrush everyday as I share the outlet and charge base with another oral-b brush user. It starts flashing red and I put it on its base. A few days ago I noticed it wasn’t charging. I troubleshot the issue and went online to Brauns service website and put a claim in on my toothbrush and sent it in for repair. I paid $3 for a envelope to ship it and they repaired/or replaced it under warranty. They are shipping it back to me. A minor inconvenience but I will have only been without my toothbrush for less than a week. Overall very happy with my purchase and even more happy Braun backs their warranty. Speedy service too!,159
57,Battery died after 6 weeks of use :(,1,"I would give it a 0 star if that was an option. The battery died after 6 weeks of use. You are supposed to replace the brush after 3 months, but I don't have to worry about that because the whole thing is useless. I am so disappointed. The rechargeable battery won't charge anymore, and you can't replace the battery. First of all, how does a rechargeable battery die so fast. Second of all, why make such a crappy design that you can't replace it when it dies. Definitely not worth the money. You can buy a few years' supply of regular toothbrush with the price of this toothbrush. I will never buy again, and recommend it to no one. It was a birthday gift. Sucks!",126
58,Changes your life!,5,"I bought an Oral-B electric toothbrush over 10 years ago and it finally died about a year and a half ago. I put off buying a new one in order to find the exact same model I had before to make sure the head replacements I already had would match, but finally gave up and just bought this one. OMG... I had forgotten how much BETTER the electric toothbrush is! And this model is SUCH an improvement over my old model! The charger is smaller and sleeker, so it doesn't take up a huge amount of space on my counter, and I love that it's black instead of white. Battery life is... I don't know, I haven't run out, so infinite as far as I'm concerned, and my teeth feel so much more amazing!

Before electric toothbrushes, my dentist would NEVER believe that I flossed, no matter how much I did and how good I got at it, but now I get nothing but compliments.",165
59,Made me brush my teeth with pleasure,5,"This is my second electric toothbrush and I purchased it after lot of research and reading many reviews.
The performance is really good and you can actually feel the difference after cleaning.

Two features that I like the most are:
- battery life that lasts for around a week based on two uses a day. Takes around 20 hours to fully charge
- timer of 30 seconds that signals you to move to another section of your teeth with a vibration

With it, I bought a set of 3 generic replacement heads",92
60,"Perfect, simple electric toothbrush. It's all you need. Great price and quality.",5,"Dentist told me I should start using an electric toothbrush a few years ago. After comparing models I chose this one. Works great.
If you really do your research and begin comparing this base model to the more expensive ones in the line ( and some can cost as much as $150 +) you may realize as I did that the more expensive ones are the exact same mechanism but they add a few more bells and whistles like fancy timer selections and variable speed settings. One even comes with Bluetooth so an app on your phone can monitor your brushing habits ( ridiculous and not worth the cost in my view)
This model does the job and beeps every 30 seconds to indicate when you should switch areas of cleaning.
This is my second one. I had my first one for over 3 years until it began losing its ability to hold a charge (as most rechargeable items do when continuously used) so it wasn't as powerful when brushing. I got a new one recently. That is another reason to not buy the more expensive ones. No matter how much you pay or how many extra gimicks it has you are going to eventually have to replace it. They don't last forever. It's just a toothbrush so skip the bells and whistles and stick with this great base model. You can't beat the price and quality.",237
61,Great toothbrush,4,"If you are looking for a simple and uncomplicated brush that still performs excellently this is the one. I would have given it five stars but for some reason in order to charge the toothbrush just placing it on the charging base was not enough. In order for the toothbrush to recharge, I had to place it on the base and then unplug and replug in the charging base to the outlet in the wall. At first, I thought I had gotten a defective item so I ordered a replacement but the replacement behaved the same. Perhaps I was unlucky enough to have gotten two defective ones in a row.

My girlfriend started using the brush too and she also noticed how much better it cleaned her teeth vs a regular toothbrush. Through an Amazon deal, I saw that the Oral B Pro 6000 was on sale for less than what I had paid for the Pro 1000 so I let my girlfriend keep the Pro 1000 and I use the Pro 6000. When comparing them they both do a great job at cleaning teeth but I will say I can notice the difference, albeit slight, between the Pro 1000 and the Pro 6000 when using professional clean mode. Apart from that the only advantage the 6000 has over the 1000 is its lithium battery which lasts significantly longer and also makes the brush much lighter.

In conclusion, this is a great product and it does just as good of a job at cleaning your teeth as the higher-end models. I would advise only going for one of the more expensive models if you really need one of the specific cleaning modes (the pro 1000 only has the one) or if you see a good deal on Amazon.",298
62,Poor battery longevity,2,"Everything about it seems to be good except for one major issue, the battery. The battery stops maintaining it's charge after a couple of years. I've had two of these and after two years both stopped recharging. And compared to the Philips Sonicare, it didn't last that long with a full charge to begin with. I've had a Philips for 6 years now and it's still got a long battery life and charging. This Oral-B one doesn't last as long on a full charge and pretty much every time that it gets charged the battery life is slightly shorter.

For this price I'd expect a toothbrush to last more than 2 years before having to be replaced. I can't say I'd recommend it or get another one. Just not worth it.",131
63,"A nice, basic, electric toothbrush.",4,"The Pro 1000 is a basic, well made, electric toothbrush, with one major issue. But before I get to the main issue, let me clear up something: The only option on it is a timer, nothing else. I'm not sure why there's a rating for Bluetooth connectivity, because this model doesn't have Bluetooth.🤔 I'm guessing it's because someone read the manual and didn't realize it was written to cover a multitude of models. Like when it speaks about a pressure sensor... This one doesn't have a pressure sensor either.

Now for the major issue:

The biggest negative is (let me write that out so there's no misunderstanding)... IT TAKES TWENTY TWO HOURS TO CHARGE FROM EMPTY, FOR A TOTAL OF 28 MINUTES OF BATTERY LIFE!!!

Yes, you read that right. Go to Braun and search for how long a single charge will last.

I know, some people will say ""Well that's a whole week of brushing twice a day, and you just always leave it on the stand when you're finished"", which they'd be right, and is exactly what you have to do, but the point is, IT TAKES AN HOUR TO CHARGE FOR A MINUTE OF BRUSHING TIME.

I don't know what 3rd World country produced these batteries for Braun, but I've got a 3 head electric razor that I've used use daily for two weeks now, and it's not below 75% of it's charge.

It's tacky to have your bathroom sink cluttered up with a charging stand that you have to use every day.",256
64,Spending the extra money up front is totally worth it!,5,"4 Reasons that spending this much money on a fancy toothbrush turned out to be worth it (other than the superior clean)…..

Great timer:
I love the timer! My last one had a 2 minute timer, but this one does a quick vibrate after 30 seconds and then the 2 minute timer is 3 vibrates. This helps me remember to spend an equal amount of time on the back of my teeth as the front. I never knew how helpful that could be!!

Takes any kind of replacement head:
This one is also great because it accepts so many different types of head. Whatever happens to be in stock in a pinch. My last one was cheaper but turned out to be more expensive when I could only buy the specific kind of replacement head online.

Stellar battery life:
I took it on a trip with me without the charger for a week and the battery held up fine.

Very waterproof:
I brush in the shower. Every day. It’s been dropped in the bathtub. Many times. It runs fine. Gross? Kinda. Practical? Absolutely.",183
65,"I really, really hate this toothbrush.",1,"It is like brushing my teeth with a chainsaw. Its loud. It vibrates your skull. Its painful. I am going back to a Sonicare Elite. So much for trying something new! I used it for a couple weeks, hoping that I could adjust to it. No way. Its going into the landfill, or maybe I'll try to take some limbs off a tree with it. This is the first negative review that I have ever left on Amazon.",78
66,Well made and solid to hold.,5,"An electric tooth brush was recommended by my dental hygienist. She recommended the Oral-B line of brushes. After using a manual brush for over fifty years, never thought about switching but I am glad I finally did. Its a whole new way of brushing teeth. The brush itself is ergonomic to hold, feels solid and well made. Its easy to use. The charging stand takes up very little space on the vanity. The charging light is small yet easy to view. I always have a full charge because I place the base of the brush on the charger when not using it.

The brush is like the electric polishing brush the dentist uses. Teeth feel so much cleaner than after using a manual toothbrush. The 1000 model is a good starter at a reasonable price point. It has just enough bells and whistles to get the job done. Should I need a replacement, I would not hesitate to buy a 2 or 3K model.
One of the best buys I have done on Amazon. Highly recommended",176
67,"Not the Cheapest Nor the Best, But a Good Combination of Both",4,"It's not got the fastest motor for Braun Oral-B toothbrushes, but it's faster than most other comparably-priced toothbrushes by Braun. The footprint on your bathroom sink is comfortably small, and as I've had occasion to drop the toothbrush and charger several times (our upstairs bathroom sink doesn't have a lot of spare counter space) I can attest that it's durable.

Good for both home and travel, and a good price/performance match.",71
68,Nice for just normal tooth-brushing. Poor instructions.,3,"My wife has had an Oral B electric toothbrush for over 15 years with no trouble and a rechargeable battery that still works. So I thought I would at least be investing in durability when I got this one. The construction looks almost exactly the same, and the brushes on my wife's model fit this one - so Oral B replacement brushes are easy to find and inexpensive. I feel that the toothbrush works well in cleaning my teeth. The timer function is great - it hesitates every 30 seconds, reminding you to move to a different quadrant of the mouth. But the ""pressure sensitive"" function either isn't working on my brush, or it is too difficult to distinguish between normal brushing and when the toothbrush is reacting to excessive pressure. Furthermore, the instructions says it has 4 modes that one can switch between by repeatedly pressing the on/off switch. But those same instructions say that you are starting either in the normal mode or the sensitive mode, with no indication of how to tell which mode it starts in, nor what the difference between any of the four modes is. Buy this only if you need a toothbrush that does what a toothbrush is supposed to do, or if you want one with a timer function.",217
69,I wish I had gone electric sooner,4,"I bought this on Cyber Monday, and have been using it pretty consistently for two months now. I was hesitant at first, because of some reviews I read, but I've got to say that I am very happy with this purchase.

My dentist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush because I have made my gums receed by brushing too hard, and exposed the nerves at the base of teeth. Hot, cold, and pressure, especially from brushing my teeth manually was causing pain. He said that it's virtually impossible to brush your teeth too hard with an electric toothbrush, and since using this one, I would have to say he's right. I have tried to put a lot of pressure on, and it doesn't hurt my teeth. I went back to brushing my teeth by hand, and it did, even when I tried not to apply pressure. I absolutely hated it. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. Not only has it vastly improved my brushing experience, but my teeth feel so much cleaner now than they ever did before. Like others have said, it's that squeaky clean feeling like you just came from the dentist. It's great! I had no idea what I was missing before.

Some reviewers have complained about battery life. I usually keep the base plugged in all the time, and I just always return it to the base, so I don't really notice, but the times I have left the base unplugged, it seemed to take a week until it ran slow and needed to be charged. *At first I thought I had a problem with my battery dying... then I timed it and realized that it pulses every 30 seconds for you to keep track of how long you are brushing.

It does not feel like a jackhammer in your mouth unless you bite down on the head. As I said, I have extremely sensitive teeth, and I think this is much better than brushing by hand.

The handle is a bit slippery, but it's really not a big deal. If you drool, just angle yourself so it doesn't go down your hand.

Overall, for the price I paid, I am satisfied with this product. I like the size and the shape of the head, and angled bristles. I feel like it really gets every angle, and down to the gumline nicely.

My only complaint is that I have never had a toothbrush wear out so fast as this one has. I have only been using it for 2 months, and it is already really worn out. The color changing bristles are yellow and less stiff than before. The replacement heads are pretty expensive, and the package only comes with one. No replacements.",462
70,Simple Electric Toothbrush,4,"I was looking for just a simple electric toothbrush, as my dentist has been recommending me to get one for years. I did a ton of research and decided I didn’t need anything fancy or with bluetooth or an app connected to my phone, and came across this one. It’s simple, with just one setting and nothing too crazy. I thought it came with a timer but I guess not, which is fine. It was buzzing every few seconds and I thought it was the battery or maybe I was brushing too hard but I think it’s just a 30 second interval marker. My teeth have never felt and looked so clean. It feels like I got a professional cleaning after I brush my teeth. I removed one star just because I don’t like that funny buzz thing it does, other than that I love it. I highly recommend it if your just looking for a simple electric toothbrush.",159
71,"A good electric toothbrush, but for the price I wish it had more",3,"I bought this to replace a 9 year old Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush that would intermittently no longer keep a charge. I never used the different modes on the Triumph, so I thought this would be a good replacement. However for the cost, I wish it would have come with a travel case. Fortunately my old Triumph case will work, but the Pro 10000 is a little smaller than the Triumph, so the fit is a little loose. I was also disappointed to find out that the Pro 10000 still uses old tech Ni-MH batteries vs newer Li-ion batteries.
**Updated** 8/12/2020: Downgrading rating to 3 from 4 due to low battery capacity and long charge time. A full charge only lasts 4 - 5 days, using twice a day for 2 - 3 minutes. The red charge light comes on after 4 days and by the 5th day it is dead. A full charge takes about 24 hours from this point! much too long. My wife's Phillips Sonicare, which uses Li-ion batteries, lasts 7 days and takes 4 hrs. to charge.",182
72,"Reasonable value, and works OK, just pretty basic",4,"Pros: Reasonable value, and works OK so far; it doesn't tickle, like some, and battery life is OK.
Feels like an improvement over a regular toothbrush, (it has got rid of some tea stain accumulation that my brush wasn't touching),

Cons: Pretty basic - one setting, like it or leave it.
I don't find the timer function very helpful - it just stutters periodically. This may be useful if you're doing a zone at a time but, if you're going around your mouth a tooth at a time, per the instructions, you're done when you're done!
Black case cover seems so much like packaging shrink wrap film that I almost tried to remove it, (glad I didn't).
On/off button isn't very obvious by feel, in the dark.
You still need more to get between your teeth so I'd recommend a Water Pik-style device, in addition.",145
73,Great for Travel purposes,5,"My wife and I each have an Oral-B toothbrush that we have had for years. Mine has a case that holds 4 toothbrushes as does my wife's. When we travel, we usually put hers in our luggage and use it on the road. The case, holding 4 toothbrushes is kind of hard to travel with as it takes up a lot of room. Recently, the built-in battery started to fail in hers. It would not stay charged so you had to keep it plugged in all the time if you wanted to be able to brush both our set of choppers. So, her birthday was coming up and I decided to get her a new one that had a smaller footprint. Most of the Oral-B models are very expensive and we just needed one that had a small base to make it easier for travel. Plus, it would take up less room on her part of the bathroom counter.

This particular model seemed to fit the bill, so I ordered it. She loves it and so do I. I can't believe how much more zip it has than mine. I have used it a few times and it seems to clean my teeth a lot better. So, I am thinking of getting my own for my side of the bathroom counter. We just got back from 8 days at Disney World and it worked great taking up less room and doing a better job of cleaning than I am used to.

Bottom line - I am very happy with this purchase. The price is reasonable and it makes a great travel companion. I am thinking of buying another so I have my own on my side of the counter.",289
74,Five stars,4,"Five stars. I am happy with this toothbrush, but the instructions say that the battery should last a week. Right from when I first started using it, the battery light starts flashing long before a week has passed. Perhaps I clean my teeth for longer than is expected. I am disappointed that you cannot remove the battery to charge it outside the toothbrush. I presume that this design is because the designers did not want water to enter the battery compartment, but I would have thought that this could be achieved using an O-ring.

I don't know what to make of the stutter-cleaning action that I believe is supposed to indicate that I am pressing too hard on the bristles. This seems to occur at random times that are not related to pressure on the bristles. I tried to test it with the toothbrush running and pressed hard against a solid object and the motor continues to run at the normal rate.",162
75,Can't beat the price point.,4,"Bought this to replace an old electric toothbrush, and at $30 the price is right--hard to beat, really. I haven't owned a more expensive model, but I find it hard to believe that a $200 or higher toothbrush would provide much benefit over this one. It's incredibly powerful and leaves my teeth feeling (literally!) squeaky clean. Highly recommended. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the brush head replacements are ridiculously expensive. I mean, they're little pieces of plastic and bristles that really should not cost so much--another good reason to buy this less expensive brush!",101
76,First electric toothbrush,4,"I've had this for a couple weeks and is my first electric toothbrush. I really like it and notice a huge difference in switching from a regular toothbrush. My teeth feel super clean with less plaque build-up and brushing my teeth is almost fun in a weird way? This seems like a very good choice for someone who just wants a basic electric toothbrush or has never used one before.

The built-in timer goes off in pulses every 30 seconds and then rapidly pulses after 2 minutes. There's a ""sensitive"" mode but I haven't used it yet and the toothbrush will make a noise if you press on your teeth too hard. It's not painful at all and the brush head feels gentle.

The box came with only one brush head and the charger so I did have to buy replacement brush heads separately. Once it was charged I was able to use it for a little over a week before needing to charge it again.",166
77,Clean!,5,"UPDATE!: Not so much an update as it is a pro tip. I read some of the negative reviews that complained about the debris around toothbrush and the base. I remove my toothbrush after every use and rinse it thoroughly and dry around the top itself. That way, there’s no accumulation of icky stuff and it still looks brand new. Just a little wipe is all it takes. I’m still very happy with my purchase.

It's been years since I've used an electric toothbrush. My current routine is a manual brushing followed by a Waterpik flossing. Frankly, I'd forgotten how good an electric toothbrush cleaning felt. My last electric toothbrush (another brand), was good, but I never felt comfortable with the ""sound"" aspect of it and the bristles were too hard. So I went back to manual.

Fast forward about a decade, and I'm completely satisfied with the Oral-B. Not only are my teeth getting cleaner, but it feels that it is assisting my Waterpik in making my gums healthier. Anybody else notice that it makes you want to brush more?

FWIW, I'm nearly 69 and have all of my teeth.",191
78,Good electric toothbrush,4,"This electric toothbrush actually rotates the brush head, instead of just vibrating. The circular shape of the brush head is great for getting to those hard to reach areas. It feels good to hold and is water resistant enough for a quick rinse in the sink (obviously would not recommend trying to submerge it or recommend you use it in the shower).

The reason I would not give it 5 stars is the battery. They should use a better quality battery, capable of holding a charge for a longer period of time. There are electric toothbrushes on Amazon that are 1/3 the price that use a better quality battery than the one in this toothbrush. I will update the review if the battery ultimately dies in the near future, which seems like a likely possibility.",135
79,Does not turn off or have pressure sensor.,2,"i mainly bought this because i want pressure sensor because i think i may be brushing to hard and it has no sensor i push on the head while its on and it keeps rotating with a lot of pressure and keeps going, also it does not turn off after 2 minutes it just does a little more vibration at 2 minutes but honestly you would need to really be paying attention to it. the brushing action it self is great does a good job brushing just the features are awful and charge time is crazy manual says up to 22 hours for full charge.",105
80,Bulky and frustrating.,3,"It does feel like it cleans well, but the flaws are annoying. 1, why doesn’t it come with a cover cap or protect the brush from outside germs? That’s just an odd unsanitary oversight that could’ve been an easy adjustment. 2, it’s base is super unstable and wobbly and falls with the easiest of breezes lol 3, when cleaning it, the little blue thing that is between the body and the brush head, it’s like a blue plastic ring to buffer the vibration, is annoying to keep track of. Is it really needed? 4, the brush head is definitely thick and it’s tough for your mouth to *not* be open while brushing, which leads to water and toothpaste to drip down the base onto your hands and the floor while holding the brush. I got this after have another famous brush brands electric toothbrush and I def will be going back.",151
81,"First Electric Brush, really happy",5,"This is my first time using an electric brush and moving away from the traditional one. I loved how this brush makes me feel on my teeth, it instills a feeling that it is actually cleaning and makes me want to brush more often.

Pros:
- Easy to charge, the holder is just perfect
- Cleans out really well without much effort from me, just follow the instructions from one of their youtube videos
- Looks good

Cons:
- You need a power source near your sink in the bathroom to help it charge
- The areas below the brush get dirty and you feel the need to come back and clean it
- A huge wire goes from the socket to where you keep your brush.

Overall this is an awesome product and I would highly recommend this to anyone just starting out with an electric toothbrush.",148
82,I like it better than my other electric toothbrush.,5,"For the last few years I've been using the other ""leading brand"" of electric toothbrush... the one with the rectangular, ""traditional"" style brush that goes up and down. I decided to try this Oral brush because I liked the concept of a round, spinning brush. I'm glad I made that decision as I like this brush better. I like that it spins on my teeth as it seems to get them cleaner, and I'm very happy with the 30 second timer. I'm now brushing my teeth longer because of that feature, so I'm spending 30 seconds on each ""section"" of my mouth/teeth, moving on only after the timer triggers it's time to brush the next area of my mouth. So I'm spending a total of two minutes brushing now, the ""recommended by dentists"" time we should take to brush our teeth. But even with this excellent brush, when I use my ""flossing waterpik"" afterward it knocks out even more tiny items the brushing couldn't dislodge. All in all using both is a great system. I HATE flossing and won't do it, so the waterpik does the job for me instead.",190
83,Died after 3 months,1,"One of the Toothbrush died after 3 months of use, other one still good. So my wife has one and I don't. Beware of this item and the battery. Should have listened to others who told me not to get them.",41
84,Fell in love,5,"I never really believed that electric toothbrushes would clean better than manual ones. I was recommended one by my hygienist and caved into buying one after getting braces. They really do clean well. I can feel a difference between when I used a manual toothbrush vs the electric. My teeth are much cleaner and I've been complimented by my hygienists and dentists for keeping my teeth clean especially with the trouble of having braces. This toothbrush will last me about a week before I have to charge it again. The brush heads are pretty expensive, but I usually buy them at Costco when they're on sale (still pretty expensive, but it may be worth it).",115
85,This is all you need,5,"As a dental hygienist speaking, save $100 and just buy this electric toothbrush instead of the expensive Oral B brushes. Use the money you save and buy floss. If you feel like you need a toothbrush that connects to your phone and has an app, you really need a break from technology.
This toothbrush has a built in vibration timer and the base is much easier to keep clean than my older oral B. You really can't go wrong with this brush.",82
86,First timer,5,"This is my first electric tool brush. My wife has had a couple different ones over the years and always told me they did a better job of cleaning. So I decided to try this one after reading up on a few of them. Simply put, it's awesome. Does a fantastic job cleaning, my mouth feels so much cleaner after I use it each night, like I was at the dentist for a cleaning. I use a substantial amount less of toothy compared to a manual brush. My wife liked it so much we got her one too now. I would (and have) highly recommend.",105
87,Original purchase and replacement both had battery issues,1,"I had to finally request a refund for this because they could not seem to find one that didn't have battery issues. The first one couldn't keep a charge for 2 days and they blamed it on me not charging it correctly, but still sent a replacement. I was very careful to follow the instructions for the second that just arrived a week ago after months of waiting, and this one does not even stay charged for one brushing. It is likely a supply chain issues with batteries becoming expensive like everything else, but if you pay this much for a toothbrush you would expect to be able to use it. I am still looking for a better option.",119
88,Loud and quit after a few months,2,"This toothbrush cleans very well. It is very loud but I did appreciate the good job on cleaning gums and teeth. What I didn't appreciate was lack of 2 minute timer- to shut it off. I ended up guessing and probably quit too soon many times. I have only had this 7 months and it won't work. It signaled needing recharging, so I did but after a day on the charger, it won't turn on at all. I will look for a product that has a timed shut-off and hopefully not so noisy.",93
89,Love it!,5,"I am a person who dislikes using a damp toothbrush. As a result, I have been reluctant to purchase one over the years because using one toothbrush multiple times through the day did not appeal to me.

However, during my last teeth cleaning, my dental hygienist was surprised that I did not use one because I have taken care of my teeth throughout the years. So I did my research and bought an Oral B 1000.

It took a few days for me to get the hang of it. I absolutely love it! The brush head--is a little smaller than a dime which makes it comfortable in my mouth. It fits on and around each tooth and allows me to learn each quadrant with ease. The brush dries so fast that it is never damp. I noticed I am no longer wasting toothpaste.

My teeth feel so clean, I'd never go pack to an manual toothbrush.",156
90,Works well for braces.,5,I purchased this toothbrush for my 13 year old granddaughter that just got braces. Her mother had braces and would not use the water pic that I bought for her so I figured my granddaughter wouldn’t use a water pic either. I researched the electric toothbrushs for using with braces and the information said these worked well. She has only had it a couple of weeks but she seems to like the oral B and says it does good with her braces,82
91,You get what you pay for!,1,"The price is cheap & so is the device. The brush head is much larger than the old waterpik brand I had previously. It is kind of bulky feeling in your hand, but I can live with these concerns. The biggest problem for me is the noise, its quite loud, and clunky. I feel like it's going to vibrate apart in my mouth everytime I use it. Only recommend if price point is the most important factor for you.",79
92,Received Defective One -- SCARY!!!,1,"I have been using Oral B plain battery operated toothbrushes for years and have always been happy. I finally decided to purchase an electric one and went with this Oral B 1000 option based on the reviews and my experience with Oral B battery operated brushes over the years. I was very excited about trying it out, but when I received the toothbrush last Friday, it wouldn't turn on. No worries, just means I need to charge it. I left it on the charger from about 9pm Friday evening until about 8am Saturday morning. No charge. The toothbrush would not work. This is pretty basic to operate, but I read the instructions again thinking -- did I place on the base incorrectly? Does it take longer to charge? Nope, did everything correctly. So .... left the brush on the charger all weekend.... still nothing. Unplugged everything, and today (Monday), I brought the brush, box, etc. and called Amazon to figure out how to return (honestly, never had to return anything to Amazon, so was not sure of the process after I had opened the item). The customer service person was very helpful and professional and quickly handled the refund as I was not sure I wanted a replacement or maybe consider another option. She instructed me to just toss the defective device. Just before I did so, a co-worker happened to walk by and saw the box on my desk, mentioned he has the same one, so I took the brush out of the box to ask him about it.... and the UNPLUGGED toothbrush felt really warm -- REALLY warm. It was not on, or at least, was not making any noises. It kept getting warmer! Long story short, we figured out how to get the bottom off with a screwdriver and basically ended up tearing the insides of the toothbrush apart to get the battery out and broken away from the terminal leads which were soldered to the ends. The battery was very warm -- almost too hot to touch. After we got it apart, the brush and battery both cooled back down. Thank goodness I felt the brush before I just dumped it in the wastebasket as I now believe it would have caught fire!!! I hesitate to say not to purchase the product as I truly think this was a fluke and not typical of Oral B products in general. But was truly scary and has me re-thinking using an electric toothbrush at all -- maybe I will just stick with the good old plain battery operated ones!",431
93,Love this toothbrush!,5,"I love the fresh ""from the dentist"" feel this toothbrush provides. I was using my boyfriend's (separate brush head of course) before I bought my own and noticed whiter, cleaner teeth after a few uses. My gums feel and look better too. It stops if you brush too hard, which was a concern for me. I was hesitant to go to a power toothbrush for that reason, but I'm glad to say that it is gentle on teeth and gums. I opted for this model over the more expensive ones because it does such a good job and has the essential options for the best brushing. I honestly don't need one more thing in my house hooked up to bluetooth, wifi or Alexa. LOL Also, when I purchased this toothbrush, there was a $10 off coupon which was really awesome and made it a great deal. I recommend this toothbrush.",150
94,This really helped me improve my oral health!,4,This really improved my oral hygiene! I went to the dentist a month ago and they told me I have 3 cavities and I was a little traumatized so I went on a buying spree for new oral hygiene products. This being one of the products. For oral b it’s a great price. The toothbrush is pretty loud but I don’t really care. The spin action is great. Needs to be charged frequently. I don’t even know what they mean by Bluetooth connectivity but the timer is pretty whack so I just use my phone timer. I went back to the dentist a week or so ago and they said my brushing has greatly improved along with flossing! I really enjoy this toothbrush. I will continue using this product for years to come.,133
95,Power lapses,2,"I bought this toothbrush and returned it. It had significant lapses in power. It would shut off and restart without prompting. I thought this was a defect. It was returned and replaced. The replacement brush behaves the exact same way. It has momentary power lapses when being used. These power lapses are a complete shut off then on again without touching the power switch. I can only think this loss of power is an internal disconnect that is probably a design mistake/flaw happening at random points. I can't believe it was designed to behave this way. Maybe I am wrong. My wife has this same model of brush only hers is maybe 7 years old and a different color. Hers is still going strong and without power lapses. I can't help but think this issue would adversely affect the longevity of the brush, but maybe not. Knowing what I do about this model of Braun toothbrush I probably would not buy it again.",163
96,No replacement batteries??,2,"I really liked this toothbrush, but as with so many other reviewers, it takes 24+ hours to recharge the battery after just a few days of use. The frequent recharging started to happen after several months of owning it. I have had it for over a year, and despite testing my frustration tolerance, I liked the toothbrush enough to buy replacement batteries. I thought they would surely be available. Not. The time has come to trash the toothbrush and it is painfully wasteful. It wasn't cheap, either - especially for a disposable. I bought 2; one for me and one for my boyfriend. I feel like an idiot for raving about how great it was. My bad for assuming I would be able to purchase replacement batteries (if it became necessary at all before failure of the switch).

I'll be purchasing another electric toothbrush today, but I guarantee it won't be an Oral B - their planned obsolescence has ended my loyalty and driven me straight to a different brand.",170
97,"Cleans teeth, but has potential to make you VERY dizzy and effect equilibrium.",2,"Was looking forward to getting this, and once it arrived, I quickly used it. After my first brushing, I was dizzy and disoriented to the point that I could not walk straight. I would like to say, I never get dizzy, I cannot remember the last time I was dizzy, so this happening minutes after I finished brushing, and being perfectly fine beforehand, is beyond coincidence.

I speculate this happens because when you apply the brush to your teeth, your head, ears, eyes, all vibrate from the spinning pressure of the brush. It is a very fast vibration that is happening in these areas, and considering ears especially are the culprit when it comes to being dizzy, off balance, etc, it stands to reason that these vibrations cause a temporary imbalance in the inner ear.

I used the next day, same issue, equilibrium off for a few hours.

3rd day, I am not even pressing on my teeth and letting the brush do what it can with very minimal pressure. All is good now, but the cleaning experience is not as impactful.

Curious if anyone else has had this experience. I see some reviews here stating this, as well as online forums saying the same thing, but would love to know your experience.",213
98,This toothbrush has improved the health of my teeth and gums,5,"I have had this toothbrush for almost a year and a half and it has helped me make significant improvement in the health of my teeth and gums. Around the time I got the brush, my dentist recommended that I switch from a manual toothbrush to an electric toothbrush. During my checkup, the hygienist had noticed signs of periodontal disease and fearing it would get worse if I didn't take action, I took their advice. My wife was already using this model and after conducting a little research (including other Amazon reviews), I decided to try it. After a brief adjustment period, there has been very little change to my routine, but a big difference in my oral health and my gums in particular. With each checkup over the past year+, I have shown improvement and my dentist has been impressed with the progress. The toothbrush itself is easy to use, holds a charge well, and continues to work the same today as it did over a year ago when I first bought it. I replace the heads about as often as I was cycling manual toothbrushes so no real change in the maintenance costs, just a slight up-front cost (but huge savings potential down the line if I can avoid costly dental procedures). My only minor gripe with the toothbrush is that you have to be diligent about rinsing out the gap between the brush head and toothbrush itself or gunk will buildup fast (and smell pretty bad as well). I now remove the brush head after every use and carefully prop it to air-dry and have largely eliminated the issue but it still requires a deeper scrub from time to time.",283
99,TOOTHBRUSH WILL NO LONGER HOLD A CHARGE,1,"This toothbrush is used ONCE daily by only ONE person. I've only had it about 2-1/2 months and it no longer holds a charge. Despite charging it daily, it doesn't even stay charged long enough to get thru the full two-minute brushing cycle. It used to only require being charged about every one-two weeks, but now I must charge it daily. When I tried to get customer support, I was told it's past warranty and nothing will be done. I've always used Phillips Sonic toothbrushes and have never had a problem. I thought I'd try Oral-B, but I won't again.",100
100,Extremely good tooth brush.,5,"I’d just like to start this off by saying the way the toothbrush charges is awesome, you just sit it on the charger and that’s it. You don’t have to plug anything into the toothbrush itself. As for the bristles they are phenomenal, I have braces so it makes it very difficult to clean out every angle. With this toothbrush I have no issues at all, it cleans absolutely everything! And the bristles are replaceable! The motor inside that activates the bristles is very powerful, you can apply pressure and it won’t stop until you’re applying too much pressure which comes in handy. This item is not heavy at all, the battery life is really long and I would highly recommend this item to anyone 5/5. Good job and keep up the good work.",134
101,Worth paying more for a better toothbrush,2,"Really dislike this Oral-B 1000 black toothbrush. Beware of positive reviews for more expensive versions that seem to show up on its page. Have to agree with previous reviewer who described it as feeling ""like a weedwacker"". Incredibly strong, loud vibration that feels cheap and clunky. Doesn't switch off after two minutes...apparently the number of 30-second warning buzzes changes, but suspect my skull has been vibrating too strongly to notice. Most importantly, my teeth don't feel as clean as when brushing with my previous Waterpik Sonicare, sadly no longer available.",90
102,Stops and starts while using consistantly,1,"The first Oral-B I received stopped every 25 seconds. Start again almost immediately, then stop and start, stop and start. It was frustrating and irritating. I returned it for a new one. The new one does the exact same thing!!!!
When I was using a Philips Sonic Care it NEVER stop while using. The only reason I switched to Oral-B Pro was per my dentist's suggestion.
I will not return this replacement, it is NOT worth my time and effort. I would not recommend this product to anyone ever.",89
103,"Good Brush, but Proctor and Gamble Does Not Support The Product",1,"This is the third one of these brushes I have bought. The design of the brush is intended to render the brush obsolete when the battery wears out, which it routinely does in about 2 years.

I'm handy, so I have even learned to unsolder and replace the batteries to extend that lifespan.

Even then when the replacement battery wore out I purchased another brush.

When I received the new brush, I plugged it in, sat it on my vanity and it promptly slid off the surface towards my wall plug and hit a tile floor from a height of over three feet. After a strong oath, I looked at the charger only to discover that, unlike it's two predecessors, it didn't have the rubber feet installed to keep it in place on a vanity. There's still a place for them on the plastic casting, they just weren't there.

I checked the packaging, and the documentation, and there were no feet to install and no mention of them.

So I wrote to Oral-B's customer service.

They responded as follows:

""We are constantly looking to optimize our products so they provide great quality and meet the needs of our consumers. We have removed the rubber feet rather than increasing the cost of the product, while still delivering a great value. We do not have rubber feet/grips available to send. ""

I've purchased 3 of these brushes -- the price has declined from over $100 to less than $40 over that time. So the manufacturer thinks that telling a repeat customer that saving less than 2 cents to create a product that will not sit on a bathroom surface without trying to commit brush-a-cide is in my interest to avoid a price increase on a product where the tooling has been paid for for more than a decade.

Willingness to lie about trivia and utter disregard for the customer is disqualifying. Feel free to buy the brush, but if you need any support at all, know you'll be utterly on your own. P & G does not care about you at all.",350
104,Poor design but cleans teeth very well,3,"There’s nothing wrong with how well it works. It works great. My teeth feel clean. There’s something wrong with the design. There’s two openings on the neck of the tooth brush. So when you brush your teeth your saliva and toothpaste gets into these openings and after brushing some of it drains all over the tooth brush or it just coats the inside. It’s pretty disgusting especially when you remove the brush head and the spite pours out. Maybe in the future they will change their design because once this tooth brush head is done, I’m going to have to change products.",102
105,EX SONICARE USER,5,"I will never go back to Sonicare after switching to Oral B. I used Sonicare for 15 years. The newer models have issues with the toothbrush mount, I had three units go bad and decided to give Oral B a try. I cannot believe the difference in feel, clean and simplicity of use. There is no comparison in overall feeling of clean. If you want a good electric toothbrush or are frustrated with your Sonicare, Oral B is your answer.",80
106,Too Powerful?,3,"This is an OK electric toothbrush. I bought mine just a few months ago. The problem I have is it is so powerful it actually hurts some areas of my mouth. There is no other setting. Plus it throws toothpaste all over my sink, that's how fast and hard it goes. Another thing I don't like, it blinks on and off when recharging. I have no bathroom door in my master bedroom so I let it charge in daylight and take it off at night because the blinking light is so powerful it bothers my sleep. I'll be buying another toothbrush. Threw away $40.00 I guess.",106
107,Can't Believe I Waited So Long to Buy an Electric Toothbrush,4,"I think this model is Oral-B's cheapest but it gets the job done. My wife and I both us it with different brush heads (dual brush head holders can be bought separately). There is plenty of charge for both of us for a couple days.

Pros:
- Good value for the money
- Enough charge capacity for two people for a couple of days
- Teeth feel cleaner than ever (when using the sensitive gums head)

Cons:
- Pretty loud
- Provided toothbrush head, the cross action, feels like it removes my gums and doesn't clean as well as the sensitive gums
- The timer is just annoying in my opinion since it stops the brush. I don't need any help with timing. I wish I could turn it off.
- The charging light flashes and is bright. Sort of annoying at night. I wish it would brighten and dim slowly instead.",152
108,low end electric toothbrush.,1,"I had an Oral B for years, and it stopped holding a charge. Why not replace it? I didn't realize there were versions that were so drastically different. This one the handle is so thin, it is hard to grip. (I have fairly large hands) The previous model I had had a much wider handle. This model has no selectable modes. It only has ""Jack Hammer mode. My previous model, had a gentel mode, pulse mode, and variable mode. This one just has a single indicator light for charging notification. The other had a battery meter. I wanted to return it, but not worth the bother. It does brush teeth.
Save up for a better model.

********
Updated review, after using for a couple weeks, it's downright painful, hard to hold and the banging on the teeth. Definitely must be the cheapest low endversion available",145
109,Excellent value,5,"I bought a Sonicare 1000 (base model like this Oral B model) on Black Friday last year at a super price. Same for this one this year. I wanted to try the Oral B after wondering if the longer head design of the Sonicare was really getting into grooves between teeth. This one ""feels"" like it is doing a very slightly better job, but no hard data on that yet. I am going to switch off between them for a while longer before relegating the one I like less to my home away from home. For both, I wish the bristles were softer so that they flex into grooves and gums more. They would need to be replaced more often, but good generic replacement heads are only about a buck each and last several months.",135
110,Not worth it! Battery issues!!!,1,"I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and was very excited to start using it. I charged it for a couple of days but the battery was dying after few seconds of each use. Had to return and replace it because of this hoping the new one would fix the issue. The new one that I received holds the battery a little longer and would let me at least finish brushing. But it's not holding charge anymore (totally different than what they've put on as the description of this product.)
If it didn't have the battery issues it could be a very good product but I have been disappointed since I received two of these and none of them are lasting more than 3-4 minutes. It says it can hold up up to 7 days!! But it's not real at all. DO NOT BUY. I was too optimistic and didn't really believe all the battery issues reviews for this product and thought it might work since it's a good brand. But I just wasted my time with it so far. I'm planning to return this one and get a refund.",192
111,"It's okay, but you could probably do better",3,"The power button is difficult to press when the brush is turned on. If you have limited dexterity, I'd recommend a different brush. Seriously, I have to use both thumbs to turn off the brush and my hands are in great health.
This brush is also really big. The ""stem"" + ""brush"" combined are so big that a lot of slobber falls out of my mouth while brushing. I've never felt so sloppy before. My last toothbrush was much smaller and less messy.
Anyways, I suspect you could find a more pleasant-to-use toothbrush.
On the flipside: My teeth do feel very well cleaned.",103
112,Manual off on battery indicator,3,"Oral B pro 1000 is a good toothbrush for the money. Have been satisfied using the AA battery spin brush lately, replacing annually and the pro 1500 is the replacement. The brush head is much smaller yet cleans better.
Cost of replacement Oral B brand brush heads is more than the after market brands, will find out if there is a quality difference justifying the higher price.
The manual says the flashing red light appears on handle only when toothbrush is needing to be recharged. After brushing teeth then turning off toothbrush got the blinking light for the first 3 days even though I store the toothbrush on the charging mount. Had me worried I have a defective toothbrush. Stopped blinking red after 4th day morning brush. I guess it charges very slowly. Hope the toothbrush lasts.",137
113,charger & toothbrush failed. Does not work,1,"I like an electric toothbrush….but this product failed on me after just a few months of use. I don’t know which doesn’t work….the charger or the toothbrush or both. In any case, the toothbrush does not turn on. I have tried several outlets, and it’s not a problem with the wall outlet.

I am really upset that I can’t return it….after a product failure in just a few months. If I had bought this a Costco, I could return it with no questions asked.

Last time I will ever buy any type of electrical product from Amazon.",97
114,Loud! Otherwise does its job.,3,"Definitely provides a deeper clean than a regular toothbrush. The charge holds pretty well for a week or two at a time, so that's nice...and the head so far is holding up after almost 3 months, another plus.

My only gripe with this device is the noise, it is SUPER loud. I guess at this price point, that's a small annoyance...but you really can't hear anything with this vibrating stick in your mouth. There's also a small hole in the brush where the noise sometimes gets louder, like its tiny gears are rattling or something.",95
115,No brainer!,5,"This toothbrush isn’t exceptionally fancy. There is no Bluetooth but who cares!? Timer function works, charger works and it really cleans my teeth! Fantastic results in just days. If you’re on a budget or just want a great no frills affordable electric toothbrush, look no further. Money well spent!",49
116,"Solid, I think",4,"I've only been using this toothbrush for about 2 weeks now, and have not been to the dentist since I started so I have no idea if it's causing any manner of improvement with the health of my teeth. With that said, I'm pretty happy, and this is my very first electric toothbrush. Easy to use, feels fine and comfortable. Only two knocks is that I do seemingly have to charge it once per week and it takes a full day to charge. My girlfriend has a different brand and it charges faster and less frequently. My toothbrush is also significantly louder than hers. Not so much that I dislike it, but if noise is a concern, this is apparently a louder toothbrush than others.",125
117,Great electric toothbrush!,5,"This electric toothbrush has changed my life, and I don't know why I've never hopped aboard the electric toothbrush train before but I'm glad I have now. I used to be so lazy about brushing for a full 2 minutes, and the last time I went to the dentist they told me that I had cavities forming and if I didn't improve my habits I would need fillings. I decided $30 was a worth it investment to prevent that from happening, and I haven't looked back since. This was super easy to set up, especially for someone like me who is a ""when all else fails read the directions"" kind of gal. I was worried the vibrations would be too abrasive, but they are nice and gentle while still being effective. Also I have a smaller mouth so the little round brush head is perfect for getting in little spots I would miss with a traditional toothbrush. Also it's not too heavy and very comfortable to hold. An added bonus is the black color makes it look very sleek and dressed up--overall less clinical looking than a lot of the electric toothbrushes I had seen. Invest in your dental health and buy this toothbrush!",204
118,Solid option without spending big bucks,4,"This toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning and it is comfortable to use if you already are used to electric toothbrushes. If you are not used to electric toothbrushes, then give it some time. Your gums will tickle less over time. I highly recommend this toothbrush. For the price, there really aren't too many comparable options. I prefer this to the Sonicare brushes that are priced about the same. The spinning head really seems to make a difference.

4 out of 5 Stars. Would be 5 stars if it was priced at $30. It is a bit overpriced for its features.",101
119,Great feeling of clean,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush so take my review with a grain of salt.
I don't know how I lived without this thing. It made my team feel WAY cleaner than a standard toothbrush. It feels very gentle yet does a great job of sweeping away plaque.

It has a timer function so that you can give each section of your mouth the right amount of time. The battery last a good long time. I only charge it once a week. The brushes have good wear. I change them every 2 months.

Good all around experience with this system.",100
120,New Brush head is a significant improvement,4,"I've been buying this model for well over 15 years - replacing them every 3 or 4 years when the battery won't hold a charge for more than a day. This particular unit goes 6 days between charges. Others I've had went 7 days between charges at the beginning of their lifecycle. Hopefully that doesn't mean a shorter lifespan for the battery.

This is the first time I've had a brush head (included with the purchase) that had the slightly angled brushes. I like it. I think it does a better job of getting in-between my teeth.",97
121,Will someone please turn off the jackhammer?,3,"After having had a manual toothbrush for the past three years, I switched back to electric. This one is well rated, and I got it. Well, my teeth feel clean, but the racket this brush makes in my mouth--yeesh! It does a great job of waking me up in the morning. My wife's Sonicare appears to be noiseless in comparison. I'm going to hold on to this for a couple of years, but I'm going to switch to an ultrasonic after that (provided I still have teeth).",87
122,I tried....,1,"Years ago I got a Sonicare and loved it but then saw all the commercials about the Oral B and how superior it was so I tried it and hated it. It was loud, grindy and did not feel like it reached everywhere. Fast forward 15 years or so later and again, I decided to give it a try. I used the brush as instructed after eating a slice of bread. You know how the white part of the bread gets between your teeth. I used this brush as directed and when finished, there were still bits of bread between my teeth. I picked up the Sonicare and brushed with that and when I looked, the area between my teeth was all clean. I don't know what people see in this brush but it must work really well for them which is great. It just does not work for me at all so i'm going back to my Sonicare and will never look back.",164
123,Recommended by a dental hygienist,5,"I am a dental hygienist. I recommend the oral b professional 1000 at least 10 times a week. I prefer it over a sonic care, the brushing action is more efficient. And all you lazy brushers need to use the 2 minute timer to keep your mouth healthy. I also recommend buying it on Amazon because it is the best price I have found. So dear Amazon all those professional 1000 oral b toothbrush orders from the Syracuse NY, especially Liverpool area are from me. Hey Oral B, I have been a hygienist for 41 years, I always recommend and personally use your products. I have used the rechargeable toothbrush for 30 years. So remember you brush at night to keep your teeth, you brush in the morning to keep your friends.",132
124,"Good product, bad on/off button.",4,"I recently purchased both Oral B 1000 and Philips Sonic Care from Amazon to figure out for myself which one is the better product, and in my opinion, Oral B 1000 is definitely a better product. Its rotating brush not only creates a feeling that some action is taking place on your teeth, but it also foams up the toothpaste a little as well. Sonic Care, in my couple of attempts, failed to foam up the toothpaste, and the whole effort felt like a complete failure.

When used on the backside of the incisors, Oral B 1000 creates this feeling that it will definitely remove all of the plaque in one attempt. Of course, it failed to do so in one go, but it certainly feels very effective behind the incisors.

Following are the only couple of issues that I have with this product:

1. Its on/off switch does an extremely poor job of communicating to the user that it’s doing its job. In comparison, Philips Sonic Care has an excellent on/off button. People at Oral B and Braun should definitely look into improving the design of their product’s on/off button.

2. I am not sure whether it has something to do with the size of the brush head, but in my few attempts, whenever I have tried to reach for the molars, it gets stuck in the mouth’s opening that leads to molars. On the few occasions that I have used it so far, I have had to tilt and twist the brush head to finally place it on my molars.

These are my only two issues with the product so far. When it comes to the build quality of the product, only time will tell. I have been using it for just a few days now.",298
125,"Good, for awhile",3,"I've owned two of these and used them for about four years now.

First one lasted about a year because I kept it on the charged plugged in all the time and the battery failed out. I assumed the charger would stop charging but that's not the case in the instructions, my mistake.

Second one battery just now stopped charging ~3 years only letting it charge to full for about 8 hours when it went red. Either battery or charger failed on this. Hesitant to buy another or upgrade for more longevity. 3 years is pretty good but it's a bit tiring not being able to swap the battery out for a new one and having to get an all new toothbrush each time. I already have several heads though so probably going to go for a third time. If 3 years to failure is expected under correct charging, it's not bad but not great, especially with modern li-ion battery technology.",161
126,Great brush,5,"I bought the aqua and white 1000 when they first came out and used it till it finally broke last month. Kept a charge all those years. Charged it twice a month from beginning to end. Great brush till I got this new 1000. It's so much quieter than my last one and the way the brush moves, wow, what an improvement over my other one. I don't see anything different when it comes to brushing over the 1500. It's just has more bells and whistles. I don't need a red light telling me I'm brushing to hard. That would be annoying. People just don't brush hard, lol. Love the brush and hope it lasts as long as the last one. I recommend.",123
127,My dentist recommended this,5,Exactly as advertised. My dentist recommended this type of rotating brush as opposed to the back and forth type as it cleans much better. I've used both kinds and I'm here to tell you this one cleans best. By far!!! It has 2 speeds but I just use it on it's highest speed and that works for me perfectly. It's simplicity is why I bought this model because I fell the other models with more speeds and functions is just sales hype. The battery lasts a long time between needing charged. The only thing I could criticize is the charging stand with the brush in it is easy to knock over.,111
128,Cheap,3,I was told by a hygienist that this toothbrush was good enough for decent brushing and plaque removal. For the last few years I have been using a manual toothbrush. But before then I had an electric toothbrush that cost like over one hundred dollars. It was much better. Sturdier. And it had UV to clean the bacteria. I do not know how to clean this toothbrush and there are no instructions for disinfecting it. However it is a good enough toothbrush. I lowered my rating….this is another dud….,89
129,Strong Pulsation...,3,"I have had Oral B in the past and ""I loved it"". This one is just an ""I like it"". The base feels hollow and not a good grip.

Has great pulsating brush power. My gums and teeth always feel super clean.",42
130,Yikes,2,"Oof. What a waste of money. I'm fairly certain the ""Oral-B Pro 1000"" is less effective than a quadriplegic with a conventional toothbrush. Nothing special here. This toothbrush reminds me of those $10 AA variety electric toothbrushes from back in the day.

Among other complaints such as the budget build quality and LOUD (and boy, do I mean loud--like, an aggressive grinding) operating noise, this thing is gross. Let me tell you why. No matter how well you rinse the toothbrush after use, to include removal and rinsing of the brush head, it WILL leave toothpaste runs down the side of your toothbrush and onto the charger/vanity... and that's just nasty. No one wants a trail of mixed up saliva, Crest, and tartar juices on their countertop. Gees.

Take a pass on this one and save your money... Or just buy thirty of the hand-held manual variety from Dollar Tree. They'll probably last longer and will certainly clean your teeth just as well if not better.",166
131,Works good,4,"It works good.

Likes:
* Deep clean feeling.
* Helps reduce staining.
* Powerful motor.
* Acceptable battery life.
* Battery low warning light.
* Ability to reach tooth surfaces in otherwise difficult areas for an electric toothbrush.

Dislikes:
* Takes 16 hours to charge, in this day an age that's too long.
* Charge stand should hold the toothbrush in more snug, it's wobbly.
* The ""engine/motor brake feature"" malfunctions allot (too much) and it's giving a ton of false positives assuming I'm brushing too hard - it even has the exact same malfunction when it isn't even brushing my teeth.

How it could be improved:
* Also include the ability for USB fast charging.
* USB firmware update patching (to fix the engine/motor brake false positive issue I mentioned in my Dislikes).",134
132,Love This Toothbrush,5,"It is very easy to use and clean. There's only one button -- power -- yet It has all of the important functions: a timer to help you gauge how much you've brush (it vibrates noticeably every 15 seconds to give you a cue to move to a different quadrant of your mouth, and a more noticeable vibration after 2 minutes), a LED to indicate low charge (and another to indicate charging), and a design that helps you prevent too much pressure (it slows down if you are pushing too hard). The handle is (at least) water resistant, and the replaceable head comes off easily, making it all easy to clean. I'm very impressed.",114
133,Effective electric toothbrush. Feels clunkier than sonicare,4,"Coming from a several sonicares, which seem forever plagued by poor battery life. This feels like a less refined, more rugged cleaning. The Oral-B is louder than the sonicare, which is expected given the combination of spin + vibration.
It seems to clean well.
The timer is different. It still measures 30 second intervals but it feels clunkier than sonicare. I like that it doesn’t automatically shut off after 2 minutes.",71
134,Interoperable with Old Braun/Oral B Type 4729,5,"I got an Oral B/Braun type 4729 electric toothbrush in the late 90s or early 2000s and loved it. The handle finally died after 20 years and I couldn't find a replacement so I bought this model. Everything of the old type 4729 model is interoperable with this new Oral-B Black Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush! (Got to love those German engineers. I wonder why they didn't win the war and I am sure they do too.) The original charger with the toothbrush and tongue cleaner holder works with the Pro 1000 and all of the original detachable toothbrush heads work with the Pro 1000. Fortunately, I did not throw out any of the original accessories and will never need to buy a new toothbrush head since the old originals work just fine. If you need a new handle for the old type 4729 then just buy the Pro 1000 handle as a replacement and you should be ok.",160
135,Great value,5,"Got this after my dentist recommended something of ""higher quality"" than a Spin Brush. It does not have any bells and whistles, but the battery lasts for several days or more and gets my teeth much cleaner, I was surprised at how much better this brush works than what I had previously. The difference is night and day. Also, the brush head is long enough that the body of the brush does not go into your mouth, so my fiancee and I can use 1 handle and just change the brush heads. If you are like me and are buying a first time ""good quality"" power toothbrush, I highly recommend this brush.",112
136,It's nice,5,"For the price, my only problem with it is that I wish it shut off after the 2 minutes were up. Also the charge does not last very long, so if I'm going away on a trip I have to make sure to charge it before I leave, or if it's a long one I might even need to bring the charger with me. I like the brush head, and the automatic setting is a good speed, not too high not too low. I have sensitive teeth so I will probably be getting the sensitive brush head next time I need to replace mine, but the default one is nice for ""normal teeth.""",113
137,good electric toothbrush,5,"Nice electric toothbrush. Came with simple plugin charger base and 1 brush head. Was actually usable out of the box, but did start charging itself when plugged in. Makes a little shaky-buzzy every 30 seconds and a longer shake after 2 minutes so you can time your brushing. This is the lowest end brush, so no Bluetooth (why would anyone need Bluetooth connectivity on a toothbrush?) Lightweight. Brush head snaps on and off fairly easily. Looks nice, refreshing to have a color other than white.",85
138,I LOVE this thing!,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush and it changed my life. I'm a vaper, was a smoker for twenty years--my teeth looked like corn. I used the Crest White Strips and started using this, worlds of difference. I HATED my teeth all my life. Now I LOVE my smile. If you're under confident about your smile, get the strips, start using this and your confidence will go through the roof! 100% pleased. Go ahead and get some refills so you don't give up the habit. Buy this, you won't be sorry!",91
139,The most useless $45 I've ever spent,1,"This toothbrush is the worse I've ever had or tried. No options to make brushing softer or smoother. I have a sensitive gums and this toothbrush almost killed them. They were bleeding all the time while brushing. Furthermore, when I pushed start button on this crazy toothbrush the paste was spreading EVERYWHERE on the bathroom, so I have to put brush inside mouth before start. Horrible experience, I wish I could return that, but unfortunately it's impossible, I've already unpacked. Ordered the other toothbrush very next day.",87
140,FEEL THE POWER!!!,5,"Powerful toothbrush!! My teeth are nothing special, but this definitely gets them (& the gums) as clean as they're ever gonna be!! Outstanding agitation at the head coupled with a good head design, means you're going to have a sparkling set to display. The battery seems to last a reasonable time and the recharger is convenient (induction type). I particularly like the little ""pause"" notices the brush gives you while using-to indicate how long you've been brushing. I look at this item as I would any of my high quality power tools I have in my garage--use a light touch, and let the tool do the work--and IT WILL, I assure you!! HIGHLY recommend.",114
141,"Dentist recommended, for good reason",5,"Pros: good design, easy for my smallish hands to handle. Pulse function breaks up the plaque so it can be rinsed away. Small footprint. If the charger eventually stops charging, it can be replaced at the Oral-B site. Accepts generic brush heads (available through Amazon). Price at Amazon is far below anyplace else.

I have seen reviews that describe the pulse function as ""like a jackhammer."" It does bounce rapidly in and out, like a jackhammer, but that's what makes it uniquely effective. I don't find it uncomfortable, just startling the first time, and it's well worth the benefit.

Con (in my opinion): the 30-second timer that stutters to remind you to change quadrants. It's mildly annoying. I can time my toothbrushing myself, thank you, and I'm always out of sync with the timer because I take just a little longer than it allows.",144
142,My brain didn’t like being vibrated,3,"My dentist said that my gum issues are the result of my brushing too hard, and I should get an electric toothbrush. I bought this one first, tried it one time, and never again because the vibration of it against my teeth and the subsequent vibration of my skull and my brain made it unusable for me.

It’s nothing to do with the quality or build or how well it cleans your teeth, it’s simply that I cannot use this because the vibrations are just too much.",87
143,Battery replacement is needlessly difficult - they want you to buy a new one...,1,"The way this toothbrush was designed makes replacing the battery challenging enough that the average consumer will not attempt. Search ""oral b pro 1000 battery replacement"" to see the step by step instructions. It is simple enough if you're comfortable soldering.

I am disappointed that it was not designed with an easy-to-replace battery. Why throw away and replace a 50$ toothbrush when a replacement battery is only a few $'s? Shame on you oral b.

Silver lining - after 5 years, the toothbrush has no issue other than the rechargeable battery needing a difficult replacement.",95
144,Back to using my good old Trusted Phillips Sonic,1,My Hygienist recommended this brush for optimal cleaning. I ordered it and it worked for about 1 week and then would not reliably be charged despite being on the charging device. Called customer service and the process of returning was not convenient but doable. Had to go through company instead of Amazon and had to return the unit before another would be sent out. I went back to using my old trusted Phillips sonic and got busy and did not return. I recently revisited the brush to see if it was charged and operational by chance before disposing of it. Completely dead despite being on the charger. My Sonic was purchased from Amazon years ago and still going strong. I would not order this brush again.,126
145,I'm impressed!,5,"I've been using electric toothbrushes for more than 50 years, and this one seems the most effective. I love the little reminder so that I don't have to look at a clock to make sure every area is getting enough brushing. It keeps my teeth feeling as if I'd just come from the hygienist. I bought the Oral B because I had bought a supply of replacement brush heads for the previous one, which was a different model that failed after less than 2 years. I would have called the cost of the heads a loss except that the one before that lasted for many years. I just have to hope this new one is more like my first Oral B. I will update my review if there's any change in my opinion about it, but for now I'm very pleased, and also thankful that they have kept the design compatible with my stock of brush heads.",157
146,Not lithium battery,1,"Listing says Li Polymer. This is clearly Ni-MH.

This is very important, because this type of battery has longevity issues if not maintained properly.

False advertising; returned.",27
147,It's OK for the price. Almost too powerful.,3,"Price was good. It cleans very well. Feels like you're putting a running roto-tiller in your mouth, not joking, if you take it out of your mouth while it's running, it will spray toothpaste and saliva all over the sink and mirror.
Do not buy this if you don't have healthy teeth and gums, it will hurt you.
Also, it vibrates every 30 seconds but doesnt shut off automatically after 2 minutes, bad, bad design. On the plus side, replacement heads aren't overpriced like my previous Sonicare. I bought 32 replacement heads for $32 on Amazon.",96
148,Dislike,2,I dislike this electric toothbrush immensely. It certainly isn’t as good as the last Braun model I had that was similar which I had for several years. This thing doesn’t hold a charge which I have noticed others saying in their reviews of this model Braun also. Perhaps had I paid more attention to the reviews before I bought it! I have to keep it in the charger. It doesn’t even hold a charge for one night till the next morning! And this thing even leaks water up my arm while I’m brushing! The only thing that it does do is to vibrate to let you know to move it to the next area in your mouth. I am sorry that I bought this Braun model electric toothbrush. Don’t buy it is my advice.,134
149,Works.,5,"Works like it should. Though I think for the price point it should offer some other things with it. A cover for the tooth brush its self would be great as I see this offered with another tooth brush I bought. The charging stand, I really wish the cord could be detached as it doesnt need to be charged all the time and is pretty bulky.

Also the stand its self should have a place to hold the tooth brush. The brush is pretty tall making it harder to fit in many spots if the brush is left on.

The timer on this is set for 2 minutes, be nice if was some way to adjust this.

My over all thoughts are is it that it's too basic for it's price points with there are many other good options on the market that compete with this. I give it 3 stars compared to my Fairywill that I paid less for and got more useful things.

I feel the product works fully like it should, and my kid really does enjoy it. I do think somethings can be improved on it, but overall works great.",194
150,Not worth the price,3,"Like a lot of reviews, I’ll add that it is very loud. Sounds cheap, kind of loud. Because of how loud it is, you can’t tell hear the “pressure sensor” (or lack of being able to tell, bc it IS loud) so that’s a feature that shouldn’t really be advertised. Sure, it cleans my teeth. Better than other electric toothbrushes that are cheaper? Not at all. Paying for the name pretty much. And it only comes with one brush attachment where others have multiple included.",85
151,You can't brush in private,2,"This thing is loud, like if I was brush my teeth on my motorcycle, I'd get pulled over for a noise violation...not because of the akrapovic exhaust...the Oral-B! And don't push too hard, the brush will stop. My old last one was so nice, just got gunky/rusty. Not sure this will last long.",53
152,Brushes and Cleans well,5,"This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush. I purchased the Pro 1000 to replace my old Oral B electric toothbrush. I haven't had any issues with it and its been a little over a year since I purchased it. Cleans my teeth well and helps to remove plaque around gumline. Recharges quickly. I had a positive report at my last dental check-up. It’s a little loud when brushing, but it's not a big deal for me as long as it cleans teeth well.",84
153,This is my first electric toothbrush and I am satisfied,4,"I have only had this for a week now so bear that in mind. I plugged it in the evening I received it and the charging light was still blinking in the morning so I was concerned that it was defective. After nearly a full 24 hours, the light went off and it has been good to go since. The holes in the brush head are a silly design defect but I run water through them when I rinse it and that seems to work. So far, it does the job and I have been pleased with it. The brushing timer is nice.",103
154,Nice,4,"We bought this to replace a sonicare electric toothbrush. There are a couple of major differences between the two: The OralB head moves in 3 directions, while the Sonicare simply vibrates at high speed side to side. The handle of the Sonicare is bigger, while the overall size of the head is smaller. The Sonicare is a little more comfortable to move around the inside of your mouth, but we feel the brush head of the OralB does a little better job of cleaning the entire tooth vs the Sonicare, due to it's multi-directional movement, and small, round brush. We got the simple ""1000"" version minus all the bells and whistles. ""Bluetooth"" on a toothbrush... SERIOUSLY?! Save your money.",119
155,"Seems good, but loud",4,"I've used a Sonicare E series for over 10 years. My current toothbrush is starting to die, and while shopping for a replacement, I saw this device had great reviews, so I wanted to give it a shot.

Pros: It seems to clean my teeth better than the Sonicare. I like the 30 second notification to tell you when to move to another section of your mouth. It's also smaller and lighter than the Sonicare.

Cons: It's loud and, for lack of a better word, vigorous. It feels a lot rougher than the Sonicare. I also don't like the button placement; it's harder to find than the Sonicare. And when you take the brush head off, there's a sharp metal spike that sticks up. Very strange design, especially compared to the Sonicare's smooth aesthetics.

Overall, the Sonicare looks and handles better, but the Oral B seems to clean better. I think a few minor adjustments to the Oral B design could make it a great toothbrush.",166
156,Everyone should have one!,5,"This thing completely changed everything I thought about brushing my teeth. I’ve used manual tooth brushes forever. I tried a sonic care when I was 16 and HATED the vibration. I couldn’t do it and it made me shy away from electronic toothbrushes. My wife had one of these she got as a gift from her mom a few years ago and I tried it with one of her spare heads. I gave this a shot and will never use a manual again, bought my own right away. It’s firm enough to get you’re teeth and gums looking right, but gentle enough not to rattle your mouth like a jackhammer. Definitely 1000% recommend this if you’re on the fence INVEST IN YOURSELF. 50 bucks is a small price to pay when considering what you get from this toothbrush and it’s longevity. (Plus all the different heads you can use for any given reason)",153
157,Switched,5,"I used a Sonicare brush for years. I don't know what changed in my head but all of a sudden I didn't like brushing my teeth because it felt like that was a jackhammer in my mouth. I took a look at this tooth brush and then noticed a $10 coupon popup. So, I bought it and I love this thing. It is not the most expensive but I wouldn't trade it for a pricier one. I love the 30 second timer * 4 which really helps me pay attention to my brushing. I also much prefer that it oscillates rather than vibrating.",103
158,meh....get the soniccare instead,3,"I didn't want to spend too much money on this as it was my 1st e-toothbrush, so I got this basic cheaper one, and well, ...it's cheap. I've used a sonic-care one before at a friends house, and that one is SO MUCH nicer. this oral b one feels and looks cheap, its very large and bulky and doesn't feel good/easy in my mouth, its really loud and the battery SUCKS hard. I have to charge it every week it seems, and it takes like over 15 hours to fully charge it. also, as the week goes on, the speed at which it operates noticeably goes slower and slower as the battery drains. its annoying. when I use it right after charging it goes super fast. there is no consistency with this thing. I wish I would have just spent the extra $ and get the sonic-care. the sonic care is quieter, feels better in my mouth and looks nicer.",160
159,Impossible to hold the toothbrush,2,"The handle is too smooth to hold if your hand is slightly damp (does everyone else manage to brush their teeth without water?) and is too round so that you cannot keep it at the right angle. The noise was more irritating than loud. It does not tell you how much battery is left (just a flashing green light), or how long you have brushed if less than two minutes. A poorly designed product: my old Oral B, made by Braun, was much better with none of these shortcomings.",89
160,Very happy so far,5,"This was my first foray into a more expensive electric toothbrush (over traditional and semi-disposable battery powered models) and its been great so far. Brushing with one of these is like the difference between scrubbing a floor with a bristle brush and using a powered floor buffer (Let the tool do the work). It turns every brushing session into a mindful contemplative activity trying to determine the most efficient way to cover all surfaces in the timed 2 minute brush window, and I'm the kind of person that enjoys analyzing every mundane part of my life like that so 5 stars from me.",103
161,It's not the noise but the job!!,5,"Some reviewers wrote that the toothbrush makes a racket. I have no problem with the noise. It makes me think it is doing the job. Just like they can make very quiet vacuums but no one would buy them because the silence made people think the vacuums weren't very powerful. I appreciate a good electric toothbrush. I am 75 and still have all my teeth so obviously my use of an electric toothbrush does the job, quiet or noisy!",79
162,My teeth have never been clearer.,5,My dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush brush after reading countless reviews on this and other brushes I choose this one. I honestly feel like this is the most bang for your buck when it comes to purchasing an electric toothbrush brush. if you are looking for a standard electric toothbrush that works as well as the more expensive ones I would strongly suggest this product.,67
163,Loses charge very rapidly,2,"I got this to replace an old oral B toothbrush, same model, I believe.
When I used it the first time, it was so much quieter than my old one, but shockingly, the battery was depleted by day 3. It has continued to lose battery, and oscillating speed since then.
I should have kept my old brush and saved the money.
Very disappointed!!",63
164,It's not that powerful.,3,I used to have a better brush than this but I lost the charger and I had to dispose of it. I bought this thinking that because is a newer model it was going to be better; Not true at all. This brush it's ok but it doesn't have enough power to clean. It sometimes stops when you want to apply a little pressure to clean deeper. The sound is horrible and the vibration is really bad. Nothing that you can call smooth or soothing. I won't buy this again.,90
165,"size is good, battery life is so-so",3,"This is my second Oral-B and I was hoping the battery life would be longer than my other one that has bluetooth and a pulsing red light when brushing too heavy. But nope, it basically needs recharging after about 8 days of twice-a-day use. My old Phillips Sonicare could go two weeks before I had to charge it, and it had more settings than this one, but the thing died after a year of use. The Oral-B seems to have a longer lifespan and is better at reducing plaque buildup (when comparing dental cleanings over the years).",97
166,"Used these for many years, Best brush you can buy hands down",5,"I have used the Oral-B mechanical tooth brushes for years. 8 years or something stupid like that. I bought the very first of this kind from costco for liek 70 or 80 bucks and it has lasted me even till this day. Only problem is that it doesn't hold a charge for as long anymore.

This is like an honest product. FOR ONCE, a business developes a product that works very well, and lasts for a long time. Most companies produce garbage designed to break after some use. Planned obsolescence. Not so with the Oral-B. As I said earlier, the old one still works, I am only replacing it because the battery is less than what it used to be.... but it STILL works!

So I bought this new one to replace it. Whats also great, aside from the build quality and long life, is that Oral-B kept the same base charger. So all of my old acccessories (brush heads, charging docks, etc...) they all work with this new tooth brush. This is how things are supposed to be designed.
A++ product, great forethought and care taken. Highly recommended.

Also, it cleans your teeth really well, lets not forget. I tried the sonicair, and that did NOT clean any where near as well as a mechanical brush. In fact the sonicair cleaned less of my teeth than my reg manual brush.Very annoyed by that purchase. The sonicair is like brushing your teeth with a tooth pick, takes forever and doesn't even clean well, a gimmicky item.

The Oral-B cleans quick as hell, and very thoroughly. This is the best brush you can own.",273
167,Great purchase,5,"I love this toothbrush! I was hesitant to buy it because of all the negative reviews, but I’m so glad I did! A lot of people are saying this is loud....I totally disagree. Of course it makes noise, like every electric toothbrush, but I don’t think it’s loud at all. I was previously using the $7 Oral b electric brush and this one is way quieter. I’ve been using it for about two weeks so far and have had no problem with the battery at all. I did follow the directions and let it charge for 22 hours before the first use. I love this brush and love the idea of being able to get different brush types for it. The only thing I wish it had was a cover to put over the brush while it’s charging. Great purchase!",140
168,Cleans teeth great,5,"I had 2 of the regular oral b standard model with rechargeable battery. Each of my oral B's lasted about 8 years I would say then they won't charge or turn on. I decided to upgrade this time at black friday to this cross action. Honestly I don't know if it's any different then the regular one it just seems they put on cross action brush head.
So probably could get away with the standard one but at least the coloring is nice.
BOTTOM LINE. This is better than most toothbrushes... a lot better ... If you use a regular toothbrush or even a crest or colgate vibrating one they do not compare. I tried to cheap out and buy a vibrate one and I hated the feeling of the vibrations and my gums were no where as clean. Definitely love the product and will probably use it for life.",150
169,Compact and really effective,5,"This is an improvement over the very good earlier model. It really gives a great cleaning and takes up very little room on the bathroom sink counter. I see there is a spot to rate the timer function, but I actually haven't seen it function. I am brushing about 1 1/2 minutes and that might be the problem. I believe they recommended 2 minutes. I find removing the tooth brush from the wand a little hard. My husband and I both use that same unit, but switch toothbrushes, of course, and this is my only real complaint about this system.",100
170,"Charge does not last, died after a week",1,"I bought this hoping to get away from changing the batteries in a cheap electric toothbrush every two weeks.
Pros: The motor seems more powerful and more quiet than the cheap toothbrush.
Cons: It takes at least a full 24 hours to charge. I did fully charge it before first use. A single charge only lasted two days. That's four toothbrushings. The instructions say to let the batteries fully discharge at least once per month. I did that hoping to get more charge. Nope. Now it won't charge at all. I didn't even get through one week's use before it died.

I can get at least two weeks of use from my cheap electric toothbrush using replaceable rechargeable batteries. That's my recommendation: Save some money and get a battery powered toothbrush and some Amazon rechargeable batteries.",136
171,Great until it stopped working,1,"Overall was good, but after around 1 month of use it stopped working.

I'm dissapointed because my wife was happy with it.

what failed?

It wont charge anymore, if you put it in the base nothing happends.

Instructions do not have a troubleshoot section..

Before first use, I read all the instructioms to avoid any missuse.

My wife used to put it to charge every weekend (since charge last 7 days as instructions says), used it twice a day..

When in the charging base device lights do nothing, and after a long time letting it in the base, it still wont charge(found instructions online about letting it there for more than 15 min if device was completly discharged).

I must say sorry for tge bad review, it did worked fine, but died too soon...

there is a bluetooth calification, but this device do not have bluetooth.... rare",147
172,It is a good electric toothbrush at a good price,4,"I don't understand why Amazon is evaluating Bluetooth connectivity or timer function, but as a electric toothbrush, this one is a good one. You can choose from a variety of heads for different cleaning needs, it is well done, the base is solid. It takes a full day to charge completely, but it lasts for three or four days when you use it twice a day for 2 to 5 minutes.",71
173,"Everything you need in an electric toothbrush, without any of the overpriced, useless, extras!",5,"This toothbrush is so much nicer than my old Oral-B! My old brush had to be all of 15 years old. I couldn't travel with it because the battery wouldn't last for more than 1 brushing session at a time. I'd brush in the am, charge all day and be barely charged to brush at night. I couldn't share the base with my husband because there wasn't enough time between charges for us both to use it!

If this new brush lasts anywhere nearly as long as my old one, I'll be ecstatic! I looked at the higher models and the lower end units, and I think this Pro 1000 has everything that is needed for the best price. Oral-B has the best priced replacement heads, a variety of heads to fit different needs, and has a built in 2 minute timer. That 2 minute timer is so helpful. I used to bring a watch into the bathroom every time I'd brush just to be sure I was brushing long enough. The timer on the brush works so much better, no more staring at a watch! It buzzes every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next section, and after 2 minutes, it does a longer buzz. What I really like is while it tells you your 2 minutes is up, it keeps working so you don't have to restart to brush any spot that needs more.

I charged the brush fully, and it lasted a full week with twice a day brushing on that single charge. I didn't want it to die, so I recharged after 1 week, so I don't know how long it will last, but I do know at least for 1 week at full strength.

This brush also has a pressure sensor, but I've never been able to trigger it. I guess I'm brushing with the proper pressure. It's a good feature to have if that's something you have an issue with. What this brush doesn't have is all of the crazy extras. Bluetooth? UV Lights? Travel case? Thanks, but no thanks. I just want clean teeth.

When I purchased, black was the cheapest. Now it's white. Unless you are tied to a color to match your bathroom, check the different colors to find the best price. However, if you can keep the brush in an enclosed area, that's the best. I saw a video as a kid of what mists into the air when a toilet is flushed. Sufficed to say MANY years later, I won't flush unless the lid is closed, and my toothbrush NEVER sits out. Youtube has a Sky 1 video demonstrating this. Watch it. Actually, don't, just take my word for it. Close the seat, and keep the toothbrush put away!",464
174,good brush for the price,4,"This is a very decent entry level electric toothbrush for the price paid. However, after having used both the entry level Sonicare and entry level Oral-B models (this one), I personally feel that the Sonicare does a better job. This brush has slightly stiffer bristles and relies more on the rotation of the brush, which is a little more abrasive on your teeth and gums. The Sonicare has a softer brush and relies on vibrations, so it tickles at first but is less abrasive. You cannot go wrong with either brush, but I will be switching back to Sonicare after a year or two of using this one.",108
175,Good starter brush!,4,"This is my first time purchasing/using a proper electric toothbrush. It's pretty neat for the price tag. I have sensitive teeth and this isn't too powerful or irritating AT ALL. At full charge and full power, it leaves my teeth feeling incredibly clean. But if it isn't at full power, it doesn't clean nearly as well and thats my only gripe.

I've been using this brush for almost 3 months now and I think it was a really good starting electric toothbrush.",82
176,USELESS. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE,1,Would rate 0 stars if I could. The battery icon gives no indication of how full or empty it is. I will literally charge this thing for an hour and I’ll be able to brush for 3 minutes before it dies. The battery life is absolutely horrible. Biggest waste of $40. There is also no 2 minute timer like the packaging says. Do not waste your money on this trash.,70
177,Simple and effective,5,"I've been using this since September and I've really been enjoying it. I had my husband try it out and he liked it so much we went ahead and bought one for him as well (we don't share a bathroom so sharing the same handle is not practical long term). It's a simple yet effective electric toothbrush. I love the timer feature and it doesn't make me feel like it's rattling my teeth out of my head when using it. Keeping It clean is simple so I don't know why so many people are complaining about it. Pop off the head after each brushing and rinse, dry, done. Don't be gross and let gunk accumulate and it will be fine. I get a full week out of each charge. It does take a long time to charge (usually about 18 hrs for mine) but you can use it during the charge cycle so I don't mind. It's a good brush! I'm very happy with it so far.",167
178,The best electric toothbrush ever!! Truly amazing and an easy to set up!,5,This is a great electirc toothbrush! I wanted a new one and this does the job and the electric connection is well done and sits near the sink. You could spill water all over it and not have a problem with the base or the fact that it is electric. I am making the assumption that you do know that electricity and water do not mix well. That is not a problem here and I got different heads for the brush which made it perfect. It also indicates as you are brushing how long you have been at it headed for 2 minutes. This is truly great!!,107
179,Satisfied,5,"I’ve had this for over a year and so far so good. I keep mine charging constantly so can’t say how well the battery life is. However, I switched because the dentist said I was brushing too hard with regular toothbrush. That was years ago and I’ve been using the electric for years. After using this for a year though and went to dentist, everything was good. Built in timer is nice although I think 2 minutes may be too much if you’re brushing 2-3 times a day. Also, needs to be wiped down every now and then due to toothpaste/water dripping down. Never really used another electric toothbrush to compare but I’m satisfied with this one.",117
180,A great surprise,5,"Having used Sonic Care for decades, I decided to try the Oral B 1000, which is a much simpler device and a fraction of the cost. I am totally impressed with how clean this got my teeth. I get staining on my lower teeth (coffee, red wine etc) and the Oral B removed them…far better than the competitor. It is noisier and less elegant for sure but I’m a convert. I don’t ever use any of the features on the fancier models and can’t imagine needing Bluetooth connectivity with a toothbrush.",91
181,LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!!,5,"This toothbrush is fantastic! The brush head is small enough to get to the back (yes. I said back) of my back molars. After I finish brushing my teeth, they feel fresh-from-the-dental-hygienist clean. And even after a full day, my teeth still FEEL clean. No buildup, no rough spots. Just smooth, polished teeth. Can't wait to see what my dental hygienist says at the next appointment.
Not sure why it asked me to rate the bluetooth connectivity. There appears to be none.",82
182,Buy something else,1,"Clunky, loud, slow, no ergonomics, oddly sized brush head, ect.
It’s like someone that has never used a toothbrush designed an electric one.
I’ve had at least 5 different electric toothbrushes and would take every one of them over this. If my dog won’t let me use it on his teeth it’s going in the trash.",56
183,It’s like the designers never actually used it at home,1,"I can’t believe how flawed this design is. You’d think after all these years, they’d have perfected their electric toothbrushes. Instead: they put in a light that flashes all night long while it charged. It’s like a siren flashing in my bathroom. Insane. It even keeps going after toothbrush has charged for hours on end, surely to the point of a full battery. Also annoying: body’s design has little crevices perfect for catching blobs of toothpaste that resist the kind of casual rinsing that reliably cleans a conventional brush. Wow.",90
184,Get the baby blue color!!!,3,"This is my second Pro 1000. The first was one I bought was baby blue color and it was great at hiding the tooth paste residue that seems to collect on these type of tooth brushes. I bought the black one this time around as it was on sale and looked nice in the photos... well it also looks nice on the bathroom sink counter... until you use it!!! Like a black car or a black motorcycle (which I also own), good luck keeping it clean!!!

The baby blue at least hides the bluish/white hue that seems to build up on these no matter how much you wash them so I recommend staying away from the black version of this model.

I will buy this brush again when the time comes but it will be back to the baby blue for me!",142
185,Battery no longer holds charge after 3 years,4,"In one month I will have owned this toothbrush for 3 years. It no longer holds a charge for longer than 3-4 days, I basically keep it plugged in to the charger now. There's no way to replace the battery without breaking the waterproofness of it. I suppose this is expected eventually; but here's your fair warning!",57
186,Lower quality that earlier models with the same model name,2,"I have purchased 4 units of this model over the years for myself and family members. I just received the 4th one and I am disappointed to see that the unit is not the same. The handle is slippery plastic and does not have rubberized grips like the earlier versions of the same model had. The unit has a louder higher pitched buzz than the earlier versions, The unit feels lighter and lower quality overall that the earlier versions.",79
187,Way too loud to use as a toothbrush,2,"Seeing this toothbrush as a “best of” on so many lists about electric toothbrushes, I thought it had to be a winner. But it is so loud I thought it was broken right out of the box. Someone else mentioned it sounding like a weed whacker and they couldn’t be more spot on. If loud noises don’t bother you or you want to know what it would sound like to have a hive of angry bees in your mouth, then by all means don’t let my review deter you. It must be a good toothbrush to be at the top of so many lists after all. As for me, since it’s non returnable I have found that it does make a fairly satisfactory grout brush for cleaning my shower so thanks Oral-b.",132
188,I really like it,5,"Easy to put together and gets teeth REALLY clean. As for a timer, I have not noticed one. I tend to brush for a longer time and do not have to restart as I do for my old brush by another manufacturer.

Oddly, I can use a lot of pressure (though there is supposed to be a cut off for that) without interruption. But reaching my wisdom teeth, the pressure or angle against the side of my mouth causes it to cut out a bit until I adjust it differently. I think it is a definite keeper!",97
189,Best toothbrush!,5,"I switched to this because my dentist recommended this toothbrush. I had problems with getting all the plaque off my teeth, especially by the gum line. It gets all of the plaque of easy and has a two minute timer. I didn’t realize it has blue tooth. I will have to try that soon.",54
190,Doesn't hold a charge (after only 8 mos.),2,"It was working pretty well when I got it, but now, only 8 mos. later, it only holds a charge for about 24-48 hours and then shuts off (not great for traveling!). I've tried to contact customer service, but can't leave them a message since their on-line interface doesn't seem to recognize this model number. I've tried to figure this out for awhile now, but am having no success. Ugh. We've had many versions of this toothbrush in our family, and this one has definitely been the worst so far.",90
191,It’s Just ok,5,"This is a general tooth brush , only one speed I’ve returned it because I needed one with more speeds, but it’s a good tooth brush If you don’t need more speeds just not what I was needing.it is not blue tooth but I didn’t care about that don’t need a bunch of Bluetooth stuff any way and it don’t have a timer and I didn’t need that either just wanted a good fast tooth brush with different levels of speed",81
192,Happy mouth!,5,"The circular motion really cleans down at the gum line and makes my mouth feel great!
As others have mentioned it is rather loud compared to others but this doesn't bother me in the least.
I also like the timer function that keeps going after the 4 quadrants are complete so I can give some attention to the biting surfaces and other parts of my mouth without having to turn it back on again.",74
193,Effective but loud and slow charging,3,"The first negative is that it seriously takes 22 hours to completely charge - very slow.
The second negative is that, as many reviewers have noted, it is VERY noisy - sounds like a very loud old car being driven too fast that will rattle itself to pieces.
However, it cleans teeth nicely and the pressure sensor works really well.
It works and I will use it, but next time I might choose a quieter version that charges up faster.",80
194,My teeth are so much cleaner,5,"Last winter, after a cleaning, my dentist recommended I get a Sonicare (she sells them in her office). I told her that the only thing holding me back was the price tag, to which she replied, ""the Oral B version is almost as good, and costs a bit less."" I used this product in place of my regular brush for about six months and my hygienist was very pleased with the results after my recent cleaning. After my cleaning the dentist popped in to check my teeth and asked if I had using the Sonicare. As an experiment or sorts, I told her 'yes,' and she commented that she could tell. It's safe to assume that the only difference between this and the Sonicare is the price. This brush has a long battery life (I took it on a 10 day vacation without the charger and the low battery indicator only activated on the last day), it's easy to clean, and has a long power cord.",166
195,I'm a dentist and I use this brush.,5,"The more expensive brushes add all sorts of doodads and geegaws, but they don't really clean any better than this one.

I tell my patients the best advice I can give them about taking care of their teeth/gums is to use an electric brush. Even the AA battery powered brushes are better than manual brushing. If you don't like the oscillating head of this type, try the sonic type.",69
196,Buy a Sonicare instead...,2,"This electric toothbrush does the job, and the heads are less expensive than the Sonicare, but I prefer the Sonicare's head over the Oral B's small round head. Plus - this brush is noisier - a small consideration, but noticeable. I found it took longer to brush my teeth with this brush than with the Sonicare, and I also don't like the fact that it continues to run after the 2-minute time has elapsed. It does give you 30-second reminders to move to a different quadrant of your mouth, but I would prefer it stop after 2 minutes like the Sonicare. Does the job, but overall a mediocre product in my opinion. I used it for about 6 months, then switched to a Sonicare.",124
197,Oral-B Pro 1000 What a Disappointment !!,1,I purchased the Oral-B Pro 1000 Black with the tiny LED on the front. LED lights when charging. LED is not lit when charging is complete. It takes a very long time to charge this electric toothbrush. I would say over 24 Hours. Then handle slips out of your hand very easily and the power button is tough to locate when toothpaste is on the handle. I would not purchase this item. There are better electric toothbrushes out there around the same price point.,84
198,Amazingly thorough and addicting,5,"My dental hygienist recommended this brand to me for my receding gum line. Not only is this thoroughly cleaning my gums, it is giving me a cleaning that I wish I had known about sooner!! I can never go back to a regular toothbrush; It just seems dirty and barbaric to me. When you get through using this thing, your teeth feel completely clean-like you just got home from the dentist. It gets every crevice. Yes, it’s that good.",79
199,"Cleans Your Teeth, But Won't Clean Out Your Wallet!",5,"I purchased this toothbrush after years and years of a manual toothbrush. Even after just ONE cleaning, this toothbrush felt as effective as a dentist cleaning! At the push of the button, the built-in timer initializes a 2-minute brushing session at four 30-second intervals. The brush will pulse when it is time to switch. This gives you 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth. If you want to get really technical in your brushing, brush 10 seconds on the inner, top, and outer sides of your teeth for each 30-second interval. I have noticed visibly whiter teeth after a few weeks.

Absolutely love this toothbrush!",106
200,Good Performance - Low Cost - A Bit Quieter would be nicer,4,"Two of us share this base to see how we like it. We have been using it for approximately 1 month and we have observed:
- It charges quickly.
-The charge lasts at least a week with 4-6 daily uses.
-The vibration seems strong.
-It is noisy, but we have not compared to others to determine if there is a quieter version.
-Good performance at a low cost = great value
We have not yet decided whether to purchase a second one of these (to eliminate constant changing of brush head) or to try a more expensive version. A little more time ti evaluate cleaning results is needed.",108
201,DO NOT BUY,1,"Wasted my money!! The product was obviously a return, I found rust on the metal bit yesterday. Let’s talk about the hole in the toothbrush head that allows water and toothpaste in. You have to clean it every time you use it. Also the power fades in and out drastically while using. Won’t be making purchases like this through Amazon. Also save your box because once you discover how bad the quality is you’ll want to return. No refunds if you throw away the box.",85
202,Metal stem corroding within a few weeks,2,"The metal stem is corroding after a few weeks of ownership. Looks like cheap grade of stainless steel metal used. This is unacceptable.
The brush works fine, and it is relatively loud to my other electric brushes, but I don't really mind as brushing is not something were low mechanical noise is important.
I have a Braun Oral B 7000 model and the metal has not corroded like this 1000 model, which I bought for my son. Shame on Braun for such poor quality. Really angry about this.",88
203,It's Trash,1,"This thing has been having problems shortly after I brought. It finally died today after months of having to keep it filly charged to work. Today the battery is full, it just barely hums though. It will keep that charge for about a week but never will work again",49
204,Timer is wildly inaccurate,3,"The “2 minute” timer barely lasts a minute. Each 30 seconds is only 17 seconds, on all 4 oral b toothbrushes we got for Christmas. Water gets trapped in the stems for the heads. Haven’t had it long enough to test battery life.",43
205,Hesitant - Worth the $,5,Love this toothbrush. I was hesitant to spend money on a toothbrush. I had a cheap electric toothbrush and decided to spend money on this one after reading the reviews. I’m not sure about the noise complaint. It doesn’t seem that loud to me but I don’t share my space with anyone else. My teeth feel so clean and I feel as though I can see a difference. I would buy again.,72
206,Cleans better than manual toothbrush,5,"I am very happy with this powered toothbrush. It is my first and after researching I found this one to be the most suitable. I didn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models and this one has suite me well. I immediately found it cleaned my teeth better than my manual toothbrush, so I'm very happy with that! When it is in your mouth it sounds really loud and vibrates to the point it sounds like the dentist tools. It took a little time to get use to it but I'm oaky with that. Make sure you turn it off when it is in your mouth otherwise you will get toothpaste thrown all over your sink.",120
207,Did not work out of the box - but customer service was great,5,"I purchased this toothbrush because I thought my other Oral-B was dying. As it turned out, I got another 3 months out of it and never tested my new toothbrush. It doesn't work. It buzzes. I'm so disappointed. I have never had a problem with Oral-B and that it came defective is disappointing and if Oral-B customer service cannot help me, I will not purchase another product. I have not contact Oral-B customer service yet; I know I have no recourse with this seller because it is past the 30 day window, but I could not recommend this product. If I get any satisfaction from Oral-B, I will update my review, but for now, this toothbrush is crap.
Update: Customer service at Oral-B was very helpful and hassle-free. I changed my rating to 5 stars on that and hoping that I like a working toothbrush worthy of a 5 star rating!",151
208,Meh. Underpowered and no separate holder for the brush,3,"I had a Sonicare model for years that finally gave up the ghost and figured I don't need more than a basic model with a brand having a good reputation, which Oral-B does.

This one has a clutch that stops the rotating head when the pressure is too high, presumably to keep from injuring the gums. But it's set so light that half or less of the pressure I was accustomed to applying makes the brush stop. That's not good.

And why no holder for the brush? It has to be kept on the body or left on the counter, since Oral-B didn't see fit to include even a cheap little stand to hold it.

Maybe I shouldn't have expected more from a basic model, but I don't think so.",130
209,Battery life is terrible,1,"I bought this toothbrush and it came in Saturday. It’s Friday of the following week now and I’ve only been able to use it once because the battery life is TERRIBLE. I had to charge for the allotted Time of 22 hours like the instructions said. When i went to brush my teeth, it vibrated and died every time. Would like a different product, maybe the battery is old? The one time i was able to use it it cleaned my teeth so well so this is very disappointing.
UPDATE:
Upon receiving another one, the same problem persists. I think I've gave enough chances.",104
210,Misleading Info,2,"The box contained an insert that said, ""Register your toothbrush and get $15.00 in instant savings"". I thought it meant a rebate, so I registered, but did not find out until completing registration that the ""$15.00 in instant savings"" consisted of coupons for overpriced Oral-B products that have to be used by the end of this year. I feel that I was misled, and I am disgusted with Oral-B. The toothbrush, which is made by Braun, is OK. Fortunately, replacement heads not made by Oral-B can be bought for much lower prices.",92
211,Totally rubbish. Spend a bit more and get something better,1,"This is a useless electric toothbrush. I wish I’d spent a little more and got something better.

My teeth don’t feel clean after and sometimes I feel like I have to brush them twice.

The “brushing too hard” feature either doesn’t work or one can’t actually feel the change in the brush movement (which indicates you’re brushing too hard).

Seriously, spend an extra $30 and get something better.",68
212,Misleading advertisment,2,"This toothbrush works just fine, but one of the main reasons I bought it was because it said it had a pressure warning in it if you are brushing to hard. I have an issue with brushing to hard and was excited about this feature.... It does not have any such feature on this toothbrush, nowhere on the box does it say it does. This is clearly purposeful misrepresentation from the seller. This along with the fact that it also does not have a lithium-ion battery but a NiMH battery. The product itself is fine, but this is a very misleading product description.",103
213,Love it!,5,"I have had one of these for about 2 years now. I bought another one as a xmas gift for my Mom. She unfortunately has arthritis and fibromyalgia, her hands especially is where she feels most pain as she has lost most of her strength. I often saw her using both of her hands while brushing her teeth with her non-electric, standard toothbrush. She was sooo happy to receive this as a gift and has loved it ever since. I also added the 3 piece extra replacement brushes so that the gift lasts a whole year. Definitely a good buy! A good investment in general, Dentist sees a difference as well!",111
214,NOT a rotating brush!,2,"The description for this product is very miseleading! I was looking for a rotating brush and not just a pulsating or oscillating one, the description for this brush lead me to believe that this would be the case if I purchased this one since it clearly said in their description ""1 Mode, Daily Clean, rotates to break up and sweep away plaque"". However, it was very obvious that this is not the case after I received the brush and tried it out. Very disappointing.",84
215,Order new received used,1,The one I received had dirty marks all over it and was not in the original sealed packaging. I don't know about you but I'm not going to use a toothbrush that has been in someone else's hands and looks like it belong to a mechanic.,46
216,It's what might imagine having a vibrator in their mouth would feel like.,4,"It cleans, that's for sure. The hard plastic can be unforgiving until you finesse moving it about. It can induce a kind of wooziness if you've been drinking alcohol. The vibrations are pretty strong through the cranium.",37
217,Sounds like a lawnmower in your mouth!,1,I have owned electric toothbrushes for years so I know they are not supposed to be so roaring loud that you feel like your teeth may come loose from the noise. I was on a chat with someone who after 20 minutes said my recourse to return the toothbrush was to call the manufacturer about the toothbrush. Then I looked at the option of just returning it to Amazon and I have to take it to Kohl's which is 10 miles away if I want a full refund - for a defective item? I think not. Chalk it up to a poor purchase choice.,104
218,I LOVE this toothbrush,5,"I love using this toothbrush.
I've owned different types of Oral B electric toothbrushes for years and this is, by far, the best I've used. My teeth feel incredibly clean after use.
It alerts you with an extra vibration every 30 seconds and that took some getting used to, but the clean feeling after brushing is remarkable. Told my family to buy one.",63
219,The best toothbrush for the money. Hands down..,5,"I had one of these a few years ago (obviously was a different model, but operated the same). It lasted about 3-4 years and we loved it. My wife and I would have our own brush heads and just switch it out each time, so therefore it was two toothbrushes in one.
This unit is awesome. Powerful, holds a charge for almost a week and cleans great.
I temporarily switched to the Quip since there was a good deal on one of the podcasts I listen to. Worst switch ever. Don't waste your money on Quip.
This brush is awesome and if it ever blows, I will buy another one just like it.",113
220,My Dentist Recommended,5,"I asked my dentist which type of electric toothbrush to purchase, and she confided that she (and her orthodontist husband) both use Oral-B themselves. As I trust her, I decided to order, and I am impressed. Using my old Crest SpinBrush, my teeth felt clean, but the level of cleanliness really depended upon the type of toothpaste. With this Oral-B (used less than a week), my teeth feel from-the-dentist clean no matter which type of toothpaste I've used. The small brush head does take some getting used to, and the 30-second timer is initially odd, but my first impressions are quite positive. If you are looking to move into a first electric toothbrush, or move up from something like the SpinBrush, this is a great product to try.",128
221,Annoying.,3,I don't need a toothbrush to tell me when to move to a different part of my mouth. It feels like the gears are slipping every 30 seconds. I've been winging it brushing my teeth all my life and it's been working just fine for me.,46
222,Zero Complaints With This Brush,5,"I've had many brushes over the years and switching to an electric was the best decision. This has been the best since switching to an electric. My teeth haven't felt cleaner after using this. The rotating head does an amazing job at covering and getting around all of your teeth.

No fancy bells or whistles on this thing which is completely fine. If you want to get the job done, look no further.",73
223,Powerful Toothbrush,3,"I've been using my toothbrush for months and while it does an amazing job of cleaning my teeth it also does an amazing job of causing me alot of pain fromthe brush itself. My gums are so sore after use, they feel like they are cut. I've had to stop using mine, just to painful. Maybe they make a softer brush head. If you have sensative gums and teeth this is not the toothbrush for you...",76
224,Very happy with purchase,5,Why did I wait so long to get an electric toothbrush. I already can see the difference in my teeth they are becoming wider with each brushing it gets into all the nooks and crannies that a regular toothbrush does not. I would’ve liked it better had it come with a travel case and a place to store the brushes I do remove my brush head after every use and clean it. Some people talked about mold so I want to prevent that right from the start. Would definitely recommend this item,92
225,Highly functional and Affordable Brush!,5,"Solid choice for an electrical toothbrush. The brush is priced very reasonably compared to other electrical toothbrushes that do very similar functions. The internal timer is handy as it lets you know when the recommended amount of brushing time is over. The brush holds a charge for 3-5 days off the charger assuming you brush twice daily for 2 minutes. The charger stand is resistant to water so it can charge the brush when wet.

The design of the brush allows for interchangeable brush heads that can be purchased separately. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade their oral health at a reasonable price.",107
226,Simple but a big step down from the premium model,3,"I had the $100+ oral b before this one and I miss the added functionality my old one had. I had to replace it because of a dead battery but it lasted 5ish years. This one doesn’t warn you when the battery is dying, it doesn’t have the red light that flashes warning of too much pressure. It’s also clunkier in my hand. Seems like these simple functions could be included without paying 2-3 times more. Still a fan of oral b tho, this toothbrush does a great job at cleaning teeth.",92
227,Great toothbrush,5,"Love the timer functions on this toothbrush, every 30 seconds for two minutes this thing vibrates to let you know to move to another quadrant, at the end of the two minutes you get a different vibration to let you know your done. I like the low battery indicator, it pretty on point. The versatility of the heads are nice too. All and all great purchase. The pressure sensor is hard to tell from the minor vibrations, once you find it you know what to do.",86
228,Worst electric toothbrush,2,"It does it’s job, but... it’s very audible, battery life sucks (maybe 3-4 brushes out of a charge) also it’s NiCd battery (I.e., cheap and the battery life is reduced if the battery isn’t discharged completely, “battery memory”) this is a known issue with most e-brushes, but it’s worth mentioning. Lastly, poor design and it shows: energy is wasted vibrating the whole dang toothbrush. There are far better e-brushes out there. Spend a little extra and get a nicer oral-b, sonicare, Phillips, etc.",83
229,Best Clean from a Toothbrush,5,I have been putting off getting this Oral B for some time. I thought a toothbrush is pretty much a toothbrush. Not even close. Within 2 brushes I felt the difference on my tooth surface. This product was worth every penny.,41
230,"Overall, pleased.",5,"I purchased two, one for my husband and myself, after a dentist recommendation to switch to an electric toothbrush due to a heavy hand. We both have been very pleased so far. The charge last for a week as expected. It does have a tendency to collect toothpaste and such between the brush head attachment and toothbrush just after a week of use. I can see this being an issue if you don’t thoroughly clean it often. However, that issue may just be common for electric toothbrushes. I’m not sure since this is our first experience with them. Overall, we are very pleased. We even purchased a nice quality, but affordable, travel case also.",114
231,It does what it says on the tin,4,"I'm neither amazed nor disappointed. It's an electric toothbrush that does what it says it will do. Actually doing what it says it will do is impressive enough these days to warrant 4 stars instead of 3 in my opinion. The previous one I had (same-ish model) latest about 4 years until the battery wouldn't hold a charge, so I anticipate the same from this one. I don't need bluetooth, notifications, voice activation, fuel cell backup power, or any other such ridiculous features that drive up the price - I just want to brush my teeth.",96
232,Wish I bought it sooner,5,"Super impressed with this brush. I've wanted to get one for years, just couldn't justify the$100 price tag at Costco. Even if this is an economy model, it works amazing, you can really feel the deep cleaning from the bristles! The higher models might have Bluetooth or other features, but if you want a high quality brushing for reasonable price, this is it! I tried to other models from Sonicare and Phillips, and this was the best by far.",79
233,First Timer,4,"Using electric toothbrush for the first time and was not skeptical and didn't want to start with a really expensive one, this seem to be working really well , my dentist recommended that e brush is a good option.

So people like me who are switching to Electric tooth brush , this is a good start. I do like the timer function of the tooth brush.",66
234,So clean!!,5,"I love brushing my teeth now. They feel so clean afterward. I would definitely recommend this brush. I thought about going a step down but I'm so glad I didn't. My only complaint is that Oral B only has one type of toothbrush head in black. They should offer each toothbrush head in black and white. But that has nothing to do with the functionality. It has plenty of power, I love the timer function, and I haven't had any problems with the toothbrush keeping charge.",86
235,Great electric toothbrush!,5,"This is a great power toothbrush, there are a lot of features such as a timer and blue tooth connectivity, although not sure why one would ever use Bluetooth with a toothbrush but hey nowadays everything is super techy these days. Anyway, I love my new electric toothbrush, it works great for me. maybe I will dig a little bit deeper into its other features. Oh, and FYI this toothbrush is rechargeable and comes with a power cord equipped dock. And another cool feature is that it prevents you from brushing your teeth to hard by stopping when too much pressure is applied. How cool is that.",107
236,Worked then died,1,"I bought this back in May and have used it daily. It was working great until one day when it just stopped working. I would put it on the charger, it would look like it was charging up then It would never turn on. Now it won’t even charge or work. :(",52
237,Power and Presicion The Ultimate Toothbrush,5,This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned. It's very powerful and the timer function helps to get a good clean every time. I find it's easiest to clean in 4 zones with the timer as it vibrates every 30 seconds. At the two minute mark it does a quick rapid pulse to let you know you made it to the end. I love the charging stand also. The only way I can see them improving it would be to add a sanitization cover. I currently use steripods for that.,93
238,Gets the job done,4,"I must say it is really loud. I’ve had other electro toothbrushes and none have made as much noise as this one. But they were also way more pricey than this one. I stopped using electric toothbrushes after my other ones broke down because of the price but when I say the cyber Monday deal on this one, I just couldn’t pass the deal. Going from a regular toothbrush to this one, I can really feel the difference on my teeth. My teeth haven’t felt so squeaky clean since I stopped using electric toothbrushes. If you’re thinking of buying an electric toothbrush, this is not a bad option but if you have the budget to spend a bit more, I would opt for a quieter one. Other than that, the design is nice, the timer pulses are useful, and it cleanses your teeth thoroughly.",144
239,"Decent, no pressure sensor though.",2,"It's a decent toothbrush that works pretty well. Just be warned, the pressure sensor has never even once worked for me, so I don't think it actually has one. It would probably get a 4* from me if that was on this model. I was overbrushing a lot at first and still do occasionally, and that pressure sensor would save me from dental damage. But I've pressed it hard to try getting it to do anything and nothing happens. Bristles keep brushing, no lights, no sounds.

So definitely do NOT give this to any kids, teens, or even young adults. They're just not going to know how hard to press.",110
240,"What the hell, Wirecutter: this toothbrush is horrible",1,"So I’ve gotten pretty good results trusting the judgment of the New York Times Wirecutter consumer column. They recommended this toothbrush quite strongly. Well, I can’t do better than to reiterate what another reviewer wrote ‘it feels (and sounds) like a lawnmower in your mouth.’ Really, this thing is cheap and rattly and it’s very much worth it to spend more and get a quality electronic toothbrush. I couldn’t care less about Bluetooth connectivity etc, but I really want something that feels smooth when I’m brushing. This thing is a nightmare.",91
241,Gum terminator,1,"Any doctor that recommends this product is be bribed. Within a month, my gun deteriorated so badly, I needed special surgery. How I'm in pain all the time. I went back to Philip Sonic care. Thank you for your efforts, but bigger pockets speaks louder than health.",47
242,Great for a first electric toothbrush,5,"I bought 2 of these for both my daughters 7 and 9 and they love it. It is not too bulky, and it has all the essential functions they need. 2 Minute timer, 30 second vibration and pressure sensor. The pressure sensor is quite important in my opinion with kids since they have a tendency to brush too hard. Battery life is good for now, they got 9 days out of them before charging. I think it is a great toothbrush when it is on sale for 30 dollars, wouldn’t recommend paying the 50 dollars when not discounted. You are better off getting the sonycare 4100 for 40 dollars if you have to pay more than 30.",117
243,"Cleans better than a manual brush, be sure to dry thoroughly when done",5,"This toothbrush cleans good but vibrates your head a little, makes you feel like someone is shaking your head back and forth. I like it though, it cleans very nicely, a lot better than a manual brush. I like that the head spins instead of just vibrates. Also be sure to take the head off each time you are done and rinse it out and wipe down the entire toothbrush. Water will get under the head and if you don’t do this, it will drip down the toothbrush and make a puddle of water. I think this is why some people say theirs stopped charging, because they thought it was dry but water dripped down onto the charger.",118
244,Not worth it.,3,"It sucks, sadly. Next time ill read the reviews prior to ordering anything here again. Its loud, needs to charge often and theres no indicator when its fully charged. Don't waste your $$ like I just did.",37
245,"Long-term review: works fine, but doesn't last",3,"I'd really like to give this 2.5 stars, but I'll give it 3 because it works fine...for a while. My previous electric toothbrush was a Sonicare, which lasted about 10 years before the battery stopped holding a charge. I looked at several reviews, and it seemed the Oral-B works just as well as the Sonicare, and the brush heads are less expensive. I found both of those things to be true.

However, this brush only lasted 3 years. The rubber part that runs the length of the brush started pulling away a few months ago, and is now at the point where it's a serious distraction while using the brush and traps water as well. So, while the brush heads might be cheaper, you'll likely need to replace the Oral-B much sooner than the Sonicare, which doesn't have the rubberized handle.",141
246,Harsh,1,"This product really hurt my teeth. I spoke with my dentist and she sugguested a sonicare- which I did end up purchasing. What is great about the sonicare vs the oral b toothbrush is the sonicare bristles actually stop moving if the brush isn't used correctly aka too much force etc. This brush did not do that for me. Also- the round head really isn't the best head for an electric toothbrush. The head should be similar to a typical, non electric, toothbrush you would use. Overall disappointed. Wish I could return it. Waste of money.",96
247,It brushes teeth.,4,"Light weight, good mouth feel to the brush head, does the job. Will not connect to my bluetooth, but then, I don't need it to. Used to brush with a manual tooth brush (who remembers those?), never need my phone's help. Minor complaint, power button concave, a bit hard to find by feel. Raised button, like on my previous Oral b electric, would be better. ""Pause"" function works well, to let you know when to change position (wife used to do that). Overall, like it a lot.",87
248,Worked great for a while,3,"This toothbrush worked really well for a while. Purchased in 2019, charge it regularly, and the motor or something is dying inside and now doesn’t clean my teeth as well due to lack of power. Doesn’t work well like it used too. Hoping there’s a replacement option since it’s only been 2.5 years. I didn’t expect it to last forever…but other reviews claim it should be much longer",68
249,Give it a try--your teeth will thank you!,5,"We both have an Oral-B Pro 1000, because they are so much better than regular toothbrushes! While these may not be the most expensive electric toothbrushes out there, they have what is necessary for a good, effective, and thorough teeth cleaning. And that's all a toothbrush needs to do! You might not be blown away by a ""smooth"" or ""gliding"" effect, but this will definitely get the job done. It's not the quietest toothbrush, but it's definitely not the loudest. It has a very good battery life, and the replacement heads do not cost an arm and a leg (like MOST do!) I also like how lightweight it is compared to the SoniCare I used to own. Really the biggest ""con"" is that it's hard to keep the toothbrush clean (the charging base and handle can get a little sticky). But then again, most electric toothbrushes are a little more messy than regular toothbrushes because of the vibrating. Overall, we are glad we made this purchase!",166
250,Highly Recommend,5,My Braun electric toothbrush brush from forever ago stopped working so I purchased this one based on Consumer Reports recommended buy. I just received it this evening and brushed my teeth before going to bed. It's so much better than my old one. It's like getting your teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist.,53
251,Never go back to manual brush,5,"Using this is like suddenly realizing you’ve been doing life wrong all along. It’s a huge difference after a manual brush. My gums and teeth all feel better and healthier. I used to think my manual brush had decently hard bristles, but using it after this makes the old brush feel super soft because my mouth has gotten more resilient. Not that the electric brush hurts or anything. And having a timer built in is actually super helpful to make sure you brush long enough and in the right zones.",90
252,Highly functional; Gets the Job Done,4,Bought this to replace a battery operated Oral B toothbrush that finally cracked after a very long time. No complaints about the new one. You don't need a bunch of bells and whistles.,33
253,This is not a PRO,2,"This is not a PRO 1000 as the description states. It is a Black 1000 and there is a decent difference between the two. Other members of my family have a Pro 1000 (they are white, not black but that’s besides the point) and the word pro is clearly listed on the box before the 1000. The Pro 1000 has 2 brush speeds and a light sensor that illuminates when you are applying to much pressure. This Black 1000 doesn’t have the pressure sensor and only has 1 speed (which is closer to the faster speed on the Pro 1000). Missing those 2 key features is a deal breaker for me. Returned for refund.",114
254,Returned to this brush after trying an Ultrasonic.,5,"After my first Oral-B died I returned to a brush but there was no going back, I purchased a nice Ultrasonic. The Ultrasonic was awesome but I just didn't feel clean. I am a heavy coffee drinker and the the back and forth didn't seem to be cutting it so I ditched it and purchased this Oral-B, loving the circular smaller heads to get deeper, and I already feel more confident after a few brushes.",75
255,Great cleaning.,4,"I've always liked Oral B and this one does a great job for thr price. But if you have a husband like mine that loves to brush his teeth in the shower and leaves it there, don't leave the brush where the shower water hits it often. I had to buy him a new one because water got inside. I realize these are water resistant and only meant for the water from brushing and cleaning, but I didn't think water splashing on it a couple times a day would affect it.",91
256,My Teeth Feel Better,5,"I was doing some research about electric toothbrushes and almost went with a Quip because it was easy and small, but then I went with this instead. There was a sale, it was it was within my price range, and I found a dentist's blog that gave it a good review! The package arrived quickly via Prime. started using it immediately and the funniest thing happened the first day I brushed my teeth. I got a compliment on my smile and then I got a compliment on my teeth being white - from two different people. Coincidence? Maybe... but I think I feel confident because my teeth are cleaner. People are noticing!",112
257,Caution If You Have Sensitive Teeth/Gums,4,"I have pretty sensitive teeth and gums, as well as quite a few fillings, and I just couldn't get used to using this. I used it twice a day for about 3 weeks and ended up going back to a standard brush. Maybe a different electric brush would work better for me, but I couldn't continue using it. The vibration just made the experience too unpleasant.

HOWEVER, it did work very well as far as cleaning goes, so I can't say the actual product is bad.",86
258,The Best Toothbrush I've ever owned!,5,"You already know the specs, so I'll get right to my review. I used to own a Phillips SoniCare E Series toothbrush and I loved it, the only problem was I had trouble getting a good angle behind my front teeth (top and bottom). The plastic head would make more contact thanks the bristles in some areas. I saw the Oral-B on sale on black Friday and a tried it. I love the round head! I feel like I have complete control and can focus on every tooth, individually. The power of this toothbrush is comparable to the Phillips, I just prefer the round brush-head to the more traditional elongated head of the Phillips. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who may be looking to replace their current toothbrush.",130
259,This product is good and you feel you are getting your teeth clean,3,"This product is good and you feel you are getting your teeth clean. My only beef with it, is it is WAY loud. It sounds like a jet engine when using and my husband can hear it with the door closed in the next room, so if you are trying to be quiet because of someone sleeping, be warned that you will hear this product. I usually have purchased the sonic care, but wanted to try this brand. I like the simple design and the heads are easy to clean. I am just not as happy with how loud it is. My ears actually kind of hurt using it. Maybe you won't find this an issue, but for me, I probably will return to the sonic brand in the future.",130
260,Dentist recommended!,5,"The brush rotates in a much smoother and gentler fashion than sonic care brands. I have pretty rough teeth, but this brush is a lot less rough itself. It will even slow the pulse while brushing, it's pretty good about reading when to do this.

Only complaint; the water pools onto the charger from brushing, and it's not very appealing to see, more of a maintenance you have to keep up on. But the value, worth it.",77
261,Cleans well,4,"This brush takes a lot of getting used to. First of all it vibrates like a jackhammer and is rather loud. I worry a bit about the effects of the vibration against my teeth. However it does seem to clean my teeth better than a manual brush. I'm trying to get used to this one so I use it every other brushing and switch off with my manual toothbrush. I wish the vibration wasn't so powerful, but maybe one of the more expensive models has that figured out. I do like the pulsing feature that lets you know to change quadrants, that has helped me brush my teeth longer.",109
262,Expensive but thorough,5,"I particularly liked the timer, dividing the teeth cleaning into quarters. Brushing seemed to go faster when I didn't have to think about it. It does a good job cleaning and I got the smaller brush attachment so I could reach back to do my wisdom teeth. I do think the brush heads are expensive especially considering they should be replaced every 3 months.",64
263,Not good for deep cleaning; tiny brush head not good for nothing,2,"I get better cleaning from my manual toothbrush. The Oral B leaves a lot of food even after I rinse before brushing. The smallest brush head came with the unit so I bought flossing heads from Amazon to see if the results would be better. Flossing heads helped some, but the cost of the Oral B replacement heads is OUTRAGEOUS, so I ordered the off brand heads. The timer function works great, though. I would not recommend this to a friend. And why would a toothbrush have Bluetooth connectivity?",89
264,"Stopped charging, SCAM WARRANTY",1,"About two and half months after I bought this it stopped taking a charge. I contacted customer service at Braun and was told to go to their website to get their mail-in instructions and return code. The website doesn't work. I tried it nimerous times over the course of weeks. For starters, it didn't show the model number so I couldn't select it. Eventually, to move forward, I selected a model that was listed and then was taken to another page that won't let you progress. So there's no way to get the approval and instructions to send it in for a replacement. I tried calling customer service back but the hold was way too long and eventually I gave up and bought a different toothbrush. I suspect the website doesn't work on purpose. Most people will give up before enduring more hassle.",143
265,The best toothbrush on the market,5,"This is our third Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrush--they last about 7 years if our experience is anything to go by, which seems more than adequate to me. They do a fantastic job of keeping your teeth clean, especially the back molars. I'm lucky in that my wisdom teeth came in like normal molars, but that means there's an extra bit of reaching I need to do to keep them clean. My dental hygienist always compliments me on the fact that I'm able to keep them shiny back there, and I credit it entirely to the shape and function of this brush. I highly recommend it.",105
266,Cleans great,4,"This gets the job done, effectively!
Just make sure not to use it when everyone is asleep because you'll wake the dead with how loud it is, lol! Okay, it isn't THAT loud, but noticably louder compared to others I've used in the past. But this one cleans the best so, it's a trade off. Also, I feel that the battery starts blinking for a recharge about every 4ish days",70
267,Love the toothbrush,5,"It doesn’t connect to bluetooth so idk why it has that option. But it’s a great toothbrush none the less. I have seen results already in the one week that i’ve had it. Whiter teeth, cleaner gums, and it simply makes brushing your teeth more exciting for me. I look forward to seeing the results after every brush. It vibrates to tell you to move on the next part of your mouth and after 2 minutes it vibrates again to tell you you’ve brushed a good amount. It turns off if you apply too much pressure which helps me a lot as i’m very heavy handed and my gums use to bleed often. But now it does not bleed at all. I love this tooth brush. I’m a happy customer",130
268,Good Toothbrush,4,I can tell my teeth are cleaner around the gums than when I used a manual toothbrush. The battery lasts at least a week between charges. The only downside is how noisy it is and getting used to the timer...minor.,40
269,Works just as well as Braun’s more costly models,5,I’ve used Braun toothbrushes for several years. My old one started coming apart near the on/off switch allowing water to enter. I chose this model compared to several higher priced ones and find it to be more than adequate. I like the look of black and white body. I also happened to have about a dozen refill brushes which fit this model.,62
270,Solid Toothbrush,4,"Everything ranging from the rotating technology to the thoroughness of the bristles clean extremely well. It's a solid toothbrush for 40 dollars and highly recommended. As to the one star missing, it could have a better battery life. Your average user would not care about the battery life due to putting it back on the charging stand after every use but I did want to point out the misleading battery life.",71
271,It's a step backwards from my previous Oral-B toothbrush,3,"This model is disappointing compared with my previous Oral-B toothbrush that lasted for 8 1/2 years before the battery died. The body of this model is a smooth plastic that is very slippery when wet. It runs at a higher speed than my previous model which is probably the reason I get fewer uses from it when I need to do the deep discharge. I haven't been able to detect any indication that I'm using too much pressure when brushing even when I purposely exert a lot of pressure. I suspect that the pressure sensing function isn't working.

What irritates me the most is that the information at the Amazon site clearly states that it contains a lithium-ion battery. Printed on both the box it came in and on the device itself is the fact that it contains a NiMH battery.",141
272,Stains your countertop,2,"When I first got it - I thought “that feels nice!” And thought it was such an upgrade from my static toothbrush.

Then after using it for about a week...I noticed these black stains on my counter.

The toothbrush material stains and leaks black dye from the toothbrush handle each time you brush your teeth.

Secondly I barely noticed any “timer” function , it just feels like the toothbrush is stalling or dying of battery so it’s hard to tell when you should move to the next quadrant. Would be better if it beeped or made some other noise.

I didn’t feel this particular toothbrush was a good buy. I prefer the $6 one I can get off the shelf at the local supermarket or pharmacy",126
273,"Easy to use, highly recommended electric tooth brush.",5,"This Oral-B electric toothbrush cleans well and is easy to use. Although I would like it to charge faster, the battery lasts through many cycles. The motor is strong and the brush cleans well. The brush heads, while not inexpensive, are easy to change. I do think the brush colors fade to quickly to suggest a changeout. I’ve had this brush for 3 years, Andy it has been entirely reliable.",70
274,My dentist recommended it. He was right.,5,"I had started with the least expensive Oral B electric tooth brush (battery powered). When it came time to replace it (it lasted for years!), I did not want to buy the more expensive, top of the line Oral B's with so many functions that I knew I would never use. Then I came across this single function, but much less expensive rechargeable unit. I decided to try it. It brushes much better than the one I replaced. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner.",88
275,WOW! They really mean it!,5,"Powerful brush. This did in one use what I normally get for a dental cleaning, it's that good. I've used SoniCare for the past 2 years. I think this Oral B model outshines even the best of my 3 SoniCare models. With that said? The vibratory action of the brush is incredibly strong. If your mouth is sensitive or if you've been squeamish about using any type of electric toothbrush, then honestly, this is not for you. At least, this is THIS model. You might want to try calling the manufacturer for them to recommend what would work best for your sensitivity.",102
276,Wore away enamel?,1,"Pro: made my teeth feel really clean.

Con: teeth were throbbing with uncomfortable temperature sensitivity after two weeks of twice daily use. Internet research has now told me that these things can actually wear away your enamel.

So if you already have sensitive teeth and/or thin enamel, steer clear.",49
277,Impressed,5,I am up in years and this is my first electric toothbrush. I have always been a stickler for brushing my teeth and I have to say my teeth have only been this clean after a dentist cleaning. Hands down it's the best. It cleans and shines my teeth so well. I will say I don't need the timer but other than that I am a huge fan.,68
278,Not right for those with crowns,1,"This toothbrush is VERY powerful. I realized in less than 10 seconds it was too powerful to use on my crowns and immediately turned it off. Fortunately, I was able to return it for a full refund. I strongly recommend that Oral B put a disclaimer in its description saying this product is too powerful for those with crown work. (The 500 model is fine.)",65
279,Dropped $10 after purchase,3,"Works well for me, the wife and kid don’t like it because it’s noisy. My 10 year old said it hurts their teeth, so I tried advising to use it very lightly but it hasn’t been used for a while.

Anyway, I’m probably the only one going to use this while the second one goes to waste.

Now I saw the price dropped from $50 to $40 about 3-4 weeks after purchase. There’s insult to injury.

Well, a dad can only try his best. Didn’t work out.",87
280,Do not purchase,1,"Toothbrush is not like other Oral-B toothbrushes that I bought in the past it is very weak and does not clean the teeth as other toothbrushes from Oral-B that I have purchased.

The brush part that attaches to the motorized part does not stay on in a strong or connected way it is loose and kind of wobbles",58
281,Came with fully discharged battery. Plastic on the cheep side.,2,"Came with fully discharged battery. Considering that NiMH batteries are usually charged 40% for long term storage this item must have been on the shelf way too long. Dead such battery deserves at least $20 discount.Plastic on the cheep side even though I have seen worst on more expensive items.
On additional note the toothbrush is normal (for me) to be sitting on the counter in the bathroom where occasional water spills are very normal so providing charger with a water warning is bad design from my point of view.
Will update after a week if it keeps the charge or goes back.",103
282,Great clean feeling!,5,"So far I really like this toothbrush. Its the first electric toothbrush I've owned, so I can't really say if its any better than others. That being said, there is a noticeable difference with how smooth my teeth feel now after using this electric toothbrush compared to my manual brush. It has a sensor that lets you know if you are brushing too hard and also pulsates every 30 seconds to let you know to move the toothbrush to the other portion of your mouth and then long vibrates after 2 minutes to let you know you are finished. Overall a good toothbrush and I'd recommend to anyone.",108
283,WOW!,5,"I had a side-to-side motion rechargeable toothbrush that I ordered from Amazon until the replacement heads were no longer available. So I bought this one. Wow- what a difference! The other toothbrush was hard on my gums and even though this one feels much more powerful, it doesn't tear up my gums! My dentist confirmed that the rotary motion is preferred and now I get it.",66
284,Excellent Toothbrush!,5,"I’ve used Oral B toothbrushes for years and I’ve never been disappointed, including this one. I have the Bluetooth 5000 as well as a 1000. After several years my 1000 was getting kind of slow so I replaced it with two new black 1000s. I liked them so much I got one for my son at college. He travels so I also got him a travel case. We are all very happy with these brushes. Battery life is great, lots of power. Cleans great and the shape is thin enough so it is very easy to use. Price is fair and it has all the features you really need. No complaints!",111
285,This is not the one,1,"We have multiple other Oral B electric toothbrushes which we love, but the brushing on this one is WAY too aggressive. This toothbrush has only one speed so there is not option to make it go slower and it feels like it is taking the surface of your teeth. It advertises a pressure setting, but that is useless when the speed of the toothbrush itself is so intense. I would advise against this toothbrush.",74
286,"Stopped working after 5 months, and started working again 2 months later",4,"This is the second Oral-B 1000 I bought. The first one was bought almost three years ago and is still going strong. This one went dead five months after purchase. I contacted Oral-B (customer service is good). Before I was about to send it back for repair, it started working again. I guess water somehow got into it. It took two months for the water to try out, and then the toothbrush started working again.",75
287,Rough on the Gums. Sonicare is better.,3,"My mother is a dental hygienist, so ever since childhood, teeth have been of high importance.
Ever since the advent of the electric toothbrush, I have had Oral-B and Sonicare products and have come to trust both.
However, my most recent purchase of this Oral-B Black Pro-1000 was rough.
HERE'S WHY:
I have directly compared Oral-B to Sonicare and can say without a doubt that both companies are durable.
BUT, the Oral-B brush scrapes up your gums. You will feel this within a few uses.
Sonicare products provide superior cleaning without being rough on your gums. Sonicare products are also much quieter.",102
288,Cheap,1,"Bought this to replace one from 15 years ago that still worked perfectly w three speeds but outer rubber was wearing off

Sadly this one is not the same or as advertised
very disappointed only one speed and engine definitely not the same
weight of product very diff too
Not sure this is real might be counterfeit",57
289,"WEAK, waste of money",1,"To be honest, I’ve been pretty spoiled with toothbrushes
Normally I spend between 180 and $250 on an electronic brush but I decided to give this one a try.
Big mistake ultimately I returned it and tried out the aquasonic that has really good reviews
The motor is extremely strong and gets my teeth dentist clean. But this one is a waste.",62
290,"Good value overall, but charging time not that great",4,"This is a good overall toothbrush for the price. My main complaint would be with the charging time. It takes much too long for a full charge. I brush in the morning and again when I'm going to bed. It should not take longer to charge than the time between brushings, as it's not fully charged, I have to use it, then it finishes charging before the next time. This isn't ideal for the battery's life. I would also say that once charged, the brush speed is very good, but that doesn't seem to last for more than a few brushings, then it's at a more normal, less powerful speed. It still works well at that speed, but I'd prefer it faster for longer, but it's just a minor complaint.",130
291,Too slowly and meager battery life,2,Knowing oral B since 15+ years this has by far the lowest battery life. After 3 says it’s gone despite the fact that the rotation speed is much lower than higher version. Back to the roots,36
292,Toothbrush,5,"I decided to wait until I had this toothbrush for some time before reviewing it. I remain very pleased with the toothbrush. I not only am pleased with how thoroughly it cleans, but like the timer function as well. It had been very easy to just brush your teeth and not pay any attention to how much time you spend. This timer function allows you to make sure you spend at least 2 minutes, while brushing all parts of your teeth equally. The brush does a very thorough job and again, I am very pleased with it.",97
293,Not at all impressed,2,"I switched from a Phillips Sonicare to this - my Sonicare was purchased in 2013 and the battery still lasted for upwards of a month at a time. This new toothbrush runs dead within a week. The vibration is very intense and I've scraped my gums using it. I don't like the awkwardness of trying to get along the gum line, and I have found from the dentist that I have some tea stains on the lower front teeth that this has not been able to get fully.",88
294,Great product. It’s worth the $,5,I am never going back to a manual toothbrush ever again! This is the best purchase I’ve made in a while. My dentist recommended I purchase an electric toothbrush as I have inflamed gums a lot due to overcrowding teeth. This has great improved my gum health and reduced inflammation. It as well leaves my teeth feeling shiny and clean. Much better than a manual could do. It’s worth the money!,71
295,AMAZING product for white teeth and healthy gums!!!!!,5,"This product is AMAZING!!!! It makes brushing so easy, holds a charge FOREVER, does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth and gums, and is much better and cheaper than my Sonicare. I'd only been using the Oral-B Pro 1000 for about a month when I went to my dentist for a checkup and cleaning. He said my teeth were noticeably whiter and my gums looked ""excellent"" and were almost perfect! I couldn't be happier about this product and am now buying them for my family members. If you want beautiful teeth and like the idea of saving money at the dentist, I highly recommend!",105
296,Works great!,5,"Shipping was fast.
The toothbrush works great! The timer works - it vibrates every 30 seconds to remind me to move on to the next quadrant, and vibrates extra long at after 2 minutes to signal the end.
I haven’t bothered trying to connect it to Bluetooth because…why? If I find a reason to, I’ll do it and update this review.",61
297,Tiger By The Tail,2,"This item is way overpowered for the job it does. It really needs a second lower speed. When using it, it vibrates quite violently and spatters tiny drops of toothpaste all over. I suspect I would get less trouble if I tried to use my Dremel MultiMaster. At least I can control the vibation with the Dremel. I was afraid this toothbrush would vibtate me into a concussion. I was also concerned about the abrasion factor on tooth enamel. It is a nicely designed product, and the interchangeable brush heads are a nice point; but the unit is severely overpowered.",100
298,Much better than regular toothbrushes,5,"I switched from regular toothbrushes to the 1000. It was a difference! I couldn’t see any leftover plaque, my mouth felt and looked cleaner than just brushing and mouthwash. There was no Bluetooth on mine but the time function worked just fine. It surprised me at first but you get used to it.",53
299,Pretty good.,4,I never tried the Bluetooth connect so this review will be updated once I try that and actually go to the dentist and see what they say. Besides that it’s very easy to use and seems to clean great! The timer function is tricky as it vibrates every 30 seconds instead of an actual count down. So keep a good memory on when to move. I just go through every quadrant one vibrate at a time. Found its best to place the toothpaste on the brush and go over your teeth prior to turning it on to brush. Spreads it good.,101
300,Great toothbrush,4,"Great toothbrush. I like that it gently pulses every 30 seconds. It is also very reliable. The charge pasta a long time. I had trouble changing the brush head the first time, when I pulled off the old one I didn't realize it left a piece of the head behind. It looked like it wouldn't fit any of the brushes. But once I figured that out, I had no problem. It fits regular Oral B brushes, and generic brands. My only complaint is that the picture in the description says it fits ALL Oral B replacement brushes, but then when you read the seller responses questions it is clear that there are exceptions. That's The only reason for losing 1 star. If the seller changes the description, I will change my review.",132
301,Good,5,"I have sensitive gums. This toothbrush really helps clean my teeth. I am not quite sure how to connect it using bluetooth and I know how to do bluetooth in general. I am not sure if it is the specific type of this toothbrush that I have that does not include the bluetooth function or what. Otherwise, it is worth the amount of money you pay.",66
302,Powerful and reliable.,5,"Wow! After the failure of two very inexpenssive CVS units, this Oral-B is really good, easily worth the money. It is powerful, doing a good job on my teeth. I really like the fact that it indicates every 30 seconds to change to another quadrant. For those who complain about slow recharge, it doesen't bother me. Just set it up in the morning, and it has enough charge for evening brushing, and is completely charged by morning! I get 13 brushings on a charge, it takes 11 hours to recharge, so It charges at a rate of 1.3 brushings each hour. That's plenty.

The CVS devices were not only unreliable, but the company discontinued them so I couldn't even get new brushes! Oral-B has a number of supliers of replacement brushes, including Oral-B themselves.",134
303,If you want to keep your teeth and turn your checkups into a reasonably pleasant experience ... you need an Oral-B,5,"I've been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for nearly 20 years. Since I started using the Oral-B, all of my six month check ups have been great.
The hygienist almost always asks what I do to keep my teeth and gums in such good shape. They are especially impressed with how clean the inside of teeth are.

My first Oral-B lasted about 14 years before the battery just wouldn't hold a charge anymore. I just purchased this as my replacement and expect it to last just as long. Germany engineering and manufacturing ... it's really hard to beat :-)",99
304,Battery is awful after 6 months. Great for basics.,3,"PROS: This toothbrush is basic, in the best way. No Bluetooth, no additional modes, just brush, timer vibrates, switch, etc, done.

Cons: I am by no means a dental hygienist. I probably brush my teeth for just about a minute twice a day. Though the misses will unplug while she makes the bathroom into a makeup studio getting ready for work. If I don’t remember to after a few days. The battery is dead. Yeah it’s a minor point, but I’ve had other versions of this, and brands, that go a week or so on a single charge. So other than great, yeah it’s good.",105
305,Ordered the same item twice and received two different items,4,"I ordered this item and was very pleased with it (5 stars). I ordered another... the same item, and received something that had the same model number on the box, but we clearly a different item. This second item isn't as good as the first... its not as fast, and doesn't appear to be as well-built. 4 stars for this one.",61
306,Major charging/batteries issue,2,"The toothbrush works fine but there’s a serious issue with the battery. It never fully charges even after an entire day. The longest I have been able to use it was 3 times in a row, then the battery drained out again. I had an older model that would work for a week without charging.
I would return it if I could, but unfortunately I threw the package away.
Do not buy.",72
307,"Bad port, but awesome brush",5,"The charging port was bad when I got it and it wouldn’t charge. When I contacted amazon they said I would have to send the toothbrush back too in order to get a replacement charging port. Don’t understand why we can’t just exchange the bad part. I have another port I can use from old brush so I’m just gonna use that because I want to use my new brush.

Update: spoke with the people at Oral B and they are sending me a new charger. Had the brush before it’s amazing! Nice deep clean.",95
308,Did you get this piece of trash from China?,1,"So I got this from you last December. Here is is April and it died this morning, neither works nor charges. Not worth it for me to send it back to you, so forget the refund, but I'd say ditch that companies stuff. Obviously their quality control is about as real as a manticore.
Also, not long before the toothbrush I bought a water pick sort of thing. It no longer holds a charge so I have to keep it plugged in when I'm using it. Another piece of trash and another supplier/manufacturer to be dumped like a clod of do-do.",101
309,no 2 minute timer,3,"Packaging and description are deceptive. The side of the package list a 2-minute timer, but no line pointing to it on the picture. There is no timer light on the product as pictured. Also the word ""pro"" is not on the box. The manual is for a Pro 1000 and Triaction 1000, the latter not listed on the OralB website. If you register the product (for a $7 coupon), you have to identify the model. There is a Pro 1000 listed, but it is not this product. It seems OralB has so many and changing models that they can't keep up with their own changes. This is my first electric toothbrush and really can't attest to actual brushing and use as I'm still getting used to it. It works so far after 2 days of use.",136
310,"Lightweight, powerful action. Easy charging. Very good cleaning!",4,"I feel like I'm coming to the e-brush era at a good time. The technology (particularly the charging) is very good. This is my first e-brush and I have to say, impressive...this cleaning head is better than the periodontal hygienist cleaning I get every 4 months, well, not, but it feels like it! I regularly floss as well. However, this circular brush action, really cleans well and also a little below the gum line, which is essential for gum health. This particular set-up is easy and the instrument is lightweight and easy to manipulate in the mouth.",97
311,The best gift for yourself and all those you.love.,5,"A perfect product for improving dental hygiene. Keeps gingivitis at bay, gets in hard to reach places and effortless operation. I personally use it longer than the 'vibration' hint reminder to change quadrants. A noticeable difference in the morning vs normal brushing. My mouth is cleaner, less ""gummy"" feeling. This item, in combination with a water-pik has saved my teeth and gums. I feel better too, as the mouth can be a gateway for bacteria when gums aren't healthy, and I do not want to ever need dentures. This is a gift for whoever uses it. My wife has her brush too, they pop off and on with an easy tug. Very, VERY glad this is in our bathroom!",119
312,Cleans great,5,I’ve had this product for at least a month now and so far I really like it. I know it’s loud but it’s only two minutes. I can live with that. I always put it back in the charging unit when I’m through. I think it works very well and it seems to clean my teeth much better than a regular brush. We’ll see if the battery holds out in four months. I have bought these toothbrushes in the past and they have lasted a long time,87
313,Oral B 1000,3,"This rotating brush is expensive for what you get. Instructions suggest brushing for 2 minutes each time. I brush twice a day about 1 minute each. If I brush a little hard, the brush stops spinning. The instructions also say to change out the brush every 3 months. Hah! It's pushing it to get 30 days from a brush replacement. Brush replacements are also expensive. After each use, the unit must be thoroughly wiped down; if you don't it drips on the charger and leaves gunk.",86
314,"This Braun is a powerhouse of a toothbrush, if not accustomed to power, go easy!",5,"I have had several Brauns, Sonics, & off brands, I am an 81yr old guy who still has teeth I should have, this is a fine toothbrush w/ latest brushed included that will shock you with power , however it does not get in between teeth as shown on TV, you need to floss or waterpik!
If you need a toothbrush & are looking @ reviews, I am a practical person that knows when a product is a fair value, I do not know if it is still a good price, I purchased BLACK FRIDAY.",95
315,Not what I expected even for that price point,2,"Coming from a Phillips sonicare to an oral B - huge difference but not in a good way
I thought this one had more than one mode, it does not, the mechanism feel bulky and brush head is just...clanky. Plus the charge - well having to charge after one or just keep it on the cherger constantly is a let down
I should not have strayed from Phillips. Will be going back to them
I'll keep these around for guests, not my fancy.",83
316,Very Cheap!!!,1,I was thought Oral B was better than my Phillips toothbrush. So instead of spending to much money I decided to try this one what a mistake. Doesn’t have a long charging time and it doesn’t cut off after two minutes of brushing. Now I’m afraid to try the other ones. Update! Stop working and I’m surprised their hasn’t been contact from the company!,64
317,I'm only upset that I didn't discover this sooner,5,"Maybe I'm a big kid at heart, or just downright immature...but this toothbrush made brushing FUN for me. But not only is it fun, it also WORKS. My teeth feel 100x cleaner than when I was using a regular toothbrush. I will say that it can be a little harsh on the gums if you're heavy handed like I am, so it will be a bit of a learning curve...but all in all, I say WORTH IT.",77
318,Spa treatment for your teeth,5,"My wife and I share the handle and have our own toothbrush head attachments. This investment has been great for our dental hygiene. I feel each time after a session of brushing my teeth that I have covered all areas of my teeth. Truly feels like a deep cleaning. I have the criss-cross action toothbrush head and my wife has the sensitive gum polish brush head. I end up having a feeling of polished, clean teeth. The pulse timer is 30 seconds long and is enough time to cover each quadrant. Takes about 2 minutes to brush. Feels great because it's not as laborious as a manual brush.",108
319,"Over-priced, under-featured",2,"This is no different or better than the $15 Oral-B electric toothbrush I purchased 10 years ago. It is just as loud, if not louder, and the pressure sensor function does not appear to work. I pressed the brush hard against my teeth to test it and it continued to run. I pressed it very hard into my finger and it still kept whirring away. Complete waste of money..I would suggest getting a $10 electric toothbrush that performs just as well as this one, or stepping up to a much more expensive one that actually has the features it advertises.",100
320,I wasn't particularly thrilled with this.,2,"I have used a sonic toothbrush for years and when it stopped working, decided to try this. I could immediately tell this did not clean as good as my old sonic. The timer function also doesn't work properly or is too complicated for me to use it correctly. A good toothbrush will stop after two minutes -- this one doesn't. It is also really noisy. Sounds like a boat motor.",70
321,Inflation?,4,"Why did I pay $40 for something I bought 6 years ago for $20? Yes, it wasn’t called pro-1000, but it was Oral B and had the same power and functionality. I only bought this one because I forgot the old one on a trip, it was still working the same as if I just bought it.

Also, this survey suggests there’s Bluetooth feature, but I’m not aware of one.

Overall it works fine, but the price increase is not justified.",81
322,Really like,4,"I really like this toothbrush. It has good power, the 30 sec “switch to a new zone” reminder is great, easy to use. Also, charges pretty fast.
Cons:
- The “you’re pushing too hard” sensor doesn’t work, I tested it and literally it stopped once the plastic part of the head was touchinf my teeth and I think it only stopped Bc the friction was too great
- I do appareciate when a toothbrush auto turns off after the 2 min- this one doesn’t.

Overall tho, I’m quite happy with the toothbrush, my teeth feel nice and clean! At the end of the day, if they didn’t it wouldn’t be a toothbrush.",112
323,STORAGE FOR MILDEW,1,"At first glance, I was thrilled to use this thing. The timer function was neat and really got me to keep cleaning when I needed too. But now it's just a function that keeps the mold inside the brush swishing around my pearly whites. I caught a slight odor of mildew this morning and being a little suspicious since I also woke up with a sore throat, I decided to inspect this toothbrush and I found some nasty mold growth throughout. Never getting this brush again. What's odd is that my husband has had the same brush and model for longer and his shows no signs of said mildew.",109
324,The absolute worst toothbrush possible,1,"This got my teeth clean, but i consistently experienced a problem where the brushhead would slip because the toothbrush is so top-heavy. it would constantly hit my lower-gums, which wasn't a problem until the ~2nd time it broke the skin-- there was blood everywhere and it was awful. I've never experienced anything like this with other electric toothbrushes. My entire mouth has been hurting for days because of it. Maybe I got a defective one with a loose brushhead, but it's not worth the pain and I will be throwing this in the garbage.",94
325,This sucks,1,"Hate it. Don't like the way it's hard to tell the difference between the 30 second sound intervals and the supposedly ""long"" stuttering sound that signals the end of the session. My old Oral-B, which I still use, only has the stuttering sound when you're at the end of the 2 minute brushing time. Can't be returned so I'm tossing it!",61
326,"Good brush. Cheap battery, wrong description.",3,"It has Ni-MH battery, not Lithium. Description is wrong. Look at the bottom of the toothbrush.
It means charger cannot be left plugged in, it will decrease the battery life. Battery needs to be run down to 10% before it is recharged, otherwise battery capacity will become less.",48
327,Makes a difference,5,I had for years the basic electric toothbrush from Oral b. This one is much better and I can tell it is cleaning more thoroughly. The timer feature has promoted longer brushing sessions as well.,35
328,Oral-B 1000,2,I was very excited to receive this and start using it. When it arrived I was quite disappointed. It is cheaply made and is not at all what I was expected from this company. The speed is very fast and you can't slow it down and brush that comes with it is very harsh on teeth. I was going to order more expensive toothbrush but I thought I give this a try before spending lot more money. I am not recommending this at all.,84
329,Harmed my gums.,1,"Hard bristles that made my gums throb in pain, even though I tried moving the adjusting my grip, hold position, and time I cleaned the tooth with it. All to no avail.
I cannot speak to whether there was a blue tooth function.
No timer. It kept going and did not shut off automatically.",54
330,Dont waste your money,1,"I saw another review here that stated it was like brushing with a weed wacker and I couldn't agree more. I have an old product from this manufacturer (about 6 yrs old) and it was great--felt good in my hand, brushing action was smooth and relatively quiet, recognizes too much pressure and promptly lets you know. Only issue with it is it will no longer hold a charge for longer than a day or two. So I bought the Oral B 1000-what a waste of money. If I hadn't thrown the box away I would have returned it. Feels awful in my hand, weed-wacker brushing action is apt description--loud and brutal, pressure monitoring is spotty. Don't waste your money.",119
331,Not that impressed,2,"Eh. I don't understand what the big buzz is about on this toothbrush. Yes, it does clean well (I guess). BUT, I just purchased this brush recently and its bristles are already weakened and not stiff/sharp. This brush also needs to be charged like every single night, like for the whole night, just to be safe. It gets annoying after awhile. I dont see this brush lasting for a good amount of time.",73
332,Strong Simple Economical Durable,5,"If this was the only tooth brush on the market the world would be a better place. Its way better than a non-electric toothbrush. It’s got a powerful brush, no needless features, it’s not complicated, it’s not expensive, generic replacement brush heads are dirt cheap, and if you like fancy expensive brush heads there are those too, and it lasts forever (10+ years? Idk... my family has 4 and they are all running like day 1). It’s gonna The best choice or close to the best choice no matter who you are/ what you are looking for. You can buy this or something 5x the price that’s only 10% better.",110
333,A feature I thought I'd like is annoying,3,"On all other electric toothbrushes, it vibrates when you reach the 3 min or whenever it is. This one vibrates whenever you're brushing too hard. I guess that's good to know, though it's annoying... but no way I was going to spend 4x as much on the premiere one that lights up when you're bushing too hard.",57
334,REPULSED. Sent apparently used/resold toothbrush.,1,"The box seemed to be factory sealed, but upon removing the various parts, the mechanical portion was covered in smudged fingerprints and had been halfheartedly ""cleaned"" of what looked like dried toothpaste. The toothbrush attachment had been completely removed from its own plastic/cardboard packaging and also looked as if it has already been used (more poorly ""cleaned"" toothpaste residue). I'm disgusted and aghast. It's like someone didn't even bother to try to disguise it was previously used. Just reglued the box and left the obviously previously used *during a pandemic* items as-is.",92
335,Ok toothbrush for daily cleaning but misses the mark,3,Honestly was super excited to get this toothbrush but ended up being a tad disappointed in the overall performance. I like how lightweight and slim the toothbrush itself is but after I brush my teeth I still can feel some grit on my teeth which I never had with my sonic are toothbrush I had prior… it doesn’t provide a very good deep clean but the timer function is a nice feature.,72
336,Best Value for Money Brush,5,"Although you may find fancier brushes with apps, bluetooth, etc. those bells and whistles are not needed and this brush works great to get the job done.
Pros:
The brush head is small and easy to maneuver
The pressure sensor pauses the brush when you apply too much pressure while brushing
Battery seems to last about a week on a single charge

Cons:
The charging stand is not waterproof
Due to the small size of the brush head, you have to brush one tooth at a time
My dentist recommended Philips Sonicare over this, but this may just be a matter of preference",103
337,High quality and very user friendly,4,"This was a much needed upgrade over a non-electric toothbrush, and it had met nearly all expectations! It is very quick to setup and extremely easy to use.

The timer function is helpful, especially for those who may be bad at keeping track of time while brushing ( like myself ).

The only thing I wish this came with was a cover for the cap like some others have, as I generally had my toothbrush out on the counter due to very limited storage space.",85
338,Quality electric toothbrush,5,"I'll admit I was very puzzled when I first bought this since I didn't read the instructions and thought the toothbrush had a defect when it kept pausing intermittently. It took several days of brushing before it finally clicked that it was the brush giving me a 30 second timer - silly me. :) I've been using it for a few months now and have had no issues, liking it a lot!",72
339,This is like a drill in your mouth,2,"I've used Sonicare and another low brand before getting this Braun brush, to replace the low brand I also bought from Amazon. I am so disappointed. The bristles are hard, the round head is too big (depth-wise) for my regular-sized mouth, and it's loud as a dentist's drill. It cuts my gums every time I use it bc the bristles are too harsh. I wish I could get my money back.",71
340,Teeth feel clean but....,4,"The toothbrush is great 👍 I'm very happy with it, but I'm very confused by the battery life.... You have to charge it for 22 hours for 40 minutes of run time? That's two 2min sessions per day for 10 days.. they really need to upgrade the batteries & charging system. But overall I'm happy enough with it & I'm going to get a 2nd one so my wife and I each have our own.",75
341,I love this electric toothbrush,5,"I have never had an electric toothbrush. My dental hygienist suggested I should get one. Well after a few months, I still love it. I feel my teeth and gums are getting cleaner than with a regular toothbrush. Not a bad price either.",43
342,There are better options,1,Have used just 3 times…the weirdest thing is I detect a smell of something like motor oil when using it. It also sounds loud like it’s struggling to spin. The size of the brush head is awkward to use when trying to maneuver behind upper molars. I’m going back to my Sonicare.,52
343,Awesome results,5,I have used a sonicare long head brush for years. I went to the dentist and had some gum issues they stated to try the rotating Oral B rechargeable brush. I ordered it and have been using for 8 months now and this has aided in my gum issues like a night and day difference. my teeth and gums feel so much more clean after use too. Last visit to the dentist produced positive results with my gum receding issue the brush is actually stimulating growth of gum better than the Philips Sonicare unit. I have ordered more Oral B units for my family I am so impressed with it.,110
344,Favorite electric toothbrush,4,"I've tried two other brands (Fairywill & Sonicare), and Oral-B is my favorite. I much prefer their rough rumbly feeling over the high-pitched vibrations of their competitors. Battery life is great, and the noise isn't a big deal. My only complaint is that I can never get the toothbrush base quite clean enough, even after rinsing everything with water, to not leave a yellow-ish stain on the charging base.",69
345,.,5,Got this for my partner who has used manual tooth brushes all their life and they were immediately impressed! They claimed it gave a much better clean than they have ever experienced! I've already recommended this to my family and they bought some too!,44
346,I should have switched years ago,5,"I should have switched years ago. Between the traditional toothbrushes and the sonic-alike toothbrush, nothing compares to Oral- B 1000 cross action electric toothbrush. My previous one sonic-like toothbrush that I owned just vibrates and mold gets collected inside the neck of the brushes which is gross. I am so glad that I invested in Oral B toothbrush. I feel that my teeth gets really clean and spotless. This toothbrush won't give you the foamy toothpaste effect but it is a great tool in cleaning and brushing your teeth well. I also appreciate that I can use a variety of different brushes if desired.",104
347,Good stuff!,5,"I had the more expensive 4000 model, which I am not sure they still sell. Left it in a hotel room, and it is now gone. I replaced it with the base 1000 model which is just fine. I used to have a Sonicare. The brush assembly and the handle were two separate assemblies, and the brush cap that screwed on to the handle would get crap inside probably from small bits of toothpaste that built up. Plus, deposits from hard water. It got real messy after a month or two.
The handle was water resistant but I would never submerge it like you can do with the Oral B. It was not as tightly sealed or built as well. Still, I used it for many years and it was quite effective at teeth cleaning and keeping gums healthy. But I can not see where the Oral B does not do just as good a job with less hassle and much easier cleaning of the appliance.",166
348,"Don't Buy This Toothbrush - loud, poor battery, and missing normal accessories",1,"Less than meet the eye. Over $100 and only one brush head and NO cap to cover the brush at night or when traveling. If you travel a lot like me you'll just have to use a freakin' plastic bag to keep the brush sanitariy inside your luggae.

Takes too long to charge (More than the 22 hours the instructions claim, which is already not good - I'm at 48 hours and still not fully ch), and the charge last fewer uses than the 6 year old Phillips model I wanted to upgrade from. Sadly it is a downgrade.

Lastly, this thing is noisy, like 73 db vs 63 for the Phillips. For those not familiar with how db works, 72db is roughly TWICE as loud as 63db",128
349,Model Changed to Clunkier Version,1,"I bough this toothbrush a while back and it was the model seen in other reviews. After accidentally leaving it in a hotel in another city, I ordered a replacement and received the item pictured. This model is much heavier and clunkier than the previous version which was sleek and light. I’ll be returning it and buying elsewhere so I can guarantee I’m getting the right product.",67
350,Only one speed that's too strong for some mouths.,3,"This works as advertised, but has only one speed, and it can be too strong for some mouths with sensitive teeth or gums. So if you need a more sensitive brushing action, get a model with two speeds, one fast like this, and one slower.

I'm replacing this one with a model that has two speeds, like my previous old model.",61
351,Small but Loud,3,I like its small size. The brushes are soft. But the toothbrush is loud and vibrates alot. I keep thinking my filling will be jarred loose. Will keep using it to see how it goes.,35
352,Awesome!,5,"My mom got me this toothbrush YEARS ago and at the time I didn't have a vanity or level surface so it kept falling and ended up with a huge crank in it that effected how the battery charged. I eventually broke down and bought a new one, and I LOVE it. Forgot how awesome it was at full power. It's like getting a cleaning from the dentist every time you brush.",72
353,Great toothbrush,5,"Hellloooooo clean teeth!! This thing is awesome. I haven't had an electric toothbrush since my mom had one for us all when we were kids, so things have changed. Easy to recharge and clean. My only suggestion is to take the head off and clean inside and the base and let it dry so it doesn't get gunky, instead of just rinsing and putting it back as it on the charger, so maybe a little bit to prop the head on would be a nice accessory for it. I have kinda sensitive teeth and have always used an extra soft toothbrush so I was a little leery about switching to an electric, but after a few days adjustment everything was fine. Just don't use pressure, but that's standard.",128
354,"Deep clean, large brush head",4,"Recently tried my boyfriends electric toothbrush, so I figured I would get one of my own, and I love it. This brush has a really deep clean, I like that the timing function doesn't completely shut off after two minutes, so if you feel like you still want a little bit of a deeper clean you can keep going without turning it back on. I do feel like the brush heads are a little bit bigger than what I expected. This does make me feel a little bit less precise, but perhaps it's really just covering more ground which is better.",101
355,Battery only lasted for 3 weeks of use.,1,"I bought this Oral B electric toothbrush to replace the same. The battery will not hold a charge longer than 10 seconds after 22 days of use. I’ve owned it for 41 days. I’ll be looking into the product warrantee if I cannot return through Amazon.
As far as tooth cleaning, it was good enough for travel.",57
356,Does the job,4,"My hygienist recommended I get some kind of rechargeable toothbrush so I settled on this one.It's good,effective and does the job.I believe my gums are doing better,and I can get the plaque much easier.Not hard to use and your teeth feel like they've just been polished.",46
357,Great purchase even though older model,5,"I was hesitant to purchase since there is a newer model with more rpms but I can’t imagine needing or wanting more. I’m not sure that much vibration on my teeth would be tolerable, this is a good balance. My teeth feel very clean. Save a little cash and get this model.",52
358,Used once and returned.,2,I can only rate the overall function of this device as this was my first ever electric toothbrush so I had little idea what to expect and nothing to compare to. As other 1- star reviewers have stated this is like a jackhammer in your head. While that’s a bit of an exaggeration it is in fact uncomfortably loud and rough in vibration. I used it once and sent it back. I replaced it with a Phillips Sonicare 5100 with which I am very satisfied.,85
359,Surprisingly Impressed!,5,"My parents have this toothbrush and have been suggesting I purchase it. I have purchased a few electric toothbrushes in the past, and always resort back to the old fashion toothbrush. I wanted to use this at least a week prior to writing a review. I am surprisingly impressed! It works well and actually feels like it cleans your teeth! It is strong and sturdy and can get to all areas in your mouth. I would definitely recommend to someone who is thinking of purchasing an electric toothbrush for a decent price. It works!",94
360,Very happy with this purchase,5,I have never used an electronic toothbrush before. Have very bad teeth. My dental hygienist explained how much use of electronic toothbrush can help the teeth even over vigorous manual brushing. I love this now i have one. Being a bit stellar toothache person this was a pleasant surprise. The 30 second warning is my favorite feature for switching focus area. The 2 minute total makes it so doable. My teeth feel so smooth to my tongue when done. My husband and I bought one toothbrush and extra brushes. We simply switch out the brushes each time. Simple.,98
361,No noticeable pressure sensor,3,"It was advertised to have a pressure sensor, that's why I chose this model. But apparently that means no pulsations when pressing hard and I honestly don't feel any difference between pulsations and oscillations, it still keeps on going, even when pressing harder, which is important for my sensitive gums. You might as well buy the cheaper verson, it does exactly the same. Minor difference would be the battery illuminating light and it seems to last longer than the basic one.",81
362,Fine...when it worked.,2,"I bought one, and the fully-charged battery didn't last a full brush. A replacement was ordered and did fine for roughly 6 months. It's really night and day using electric over a conventional toothbrush. Unfortunately, now I have the same battery issue, and the product is outside of the return window. It appears the quality control and longevity for these batteries is just generally very poor. I will be trying out another brand, and I suggest anyone reading this do the same.",82
363,Wish I purchased it sooner....,5,"This is a great electric toothbrush. Frankly, I don't have anything to compare it to since this is my first one but I wish I purchased it sooner. Beats the hell out of manual brushing. One thing I'll mention is that as a couple, you only need one. My wife and I use the same brush (handle) but each have our own brush head. It's worked great so far.",69
364,You need an electric toothbrush and this one is pretty good,5,"My dentist doesn't shut up about how smart I am for using one of these and for how great my teeth are. If you're not using an electric toothbrush, you're not really cleaning your teeth that well. It's a simple fact.
I don't see any point to buying the super expensive models, this one brings all the quality and efficiency at a reasonable price. I personally don't think the bells and whistles of the more expensive toothbrushes are necessary. But regardless, if you're not using an electric toothbrush, just buy one. You won't regret it.",95
365,It did not work for me,1,"I bought this toothbrush because it had very high ratings. It stopped working after couple of weeks. I returned it and bought another one thinking somehow the one I got initially was defective or bad luck or whatever. The 2nd one lasted just enough that the returned window closed. The same thing happened to the 2nd one. It just stopped working. It had all the power but when i would press the start button, nothing would happens even though the lights were on.",83
366,Gets the Job Done Right!,5,"I like this toothbrush a lot! It cleans much better than a manual toothbrush!!!! It alerts you when it needs to be recharged. It also has a function where it vibrates on and off if you have left the toothbrush in one spot for a long time. Considering how expensive electric toothbrushes can be, I love this one because it is reasonably priced and gets the job done right! I wish it came with more brush heads!",77
367,More Expensive but Lesser Quality,2,"I bought this to replace another Oral B tooth brush. It was one of the cheaper electric tooth brushes they have. This one was double the price though.

The tooth brush head and unit do not make perfect contact so it leaks water from the head.

There is an opening on Oral B Tooth brush heads for easier cleaning. This tooth brush just spits the water, saliva and toothpaste mix from that opening all over me and my shirt.

I’ve given it a good go (over six months) but it’s tine to retire this hot mess of a unit and go back to my cheapy Oral B that had none of these issues.",113
368,Prefer the “other” top rated electric toothbrush,3,"This brush compared to another well-known brand that I owned for several years and it just suddenly died, is just not as smooth, quiet, battery doesn’t last nearly as long. I hate to buy another electric but the brand that starts with the letter before “Q” is my preference. The brush feels very rigid. It doesn’t glide nicely on your teeth.",61
369,Works great,5,"Way too many people complain about this. Works great, does what it’s supposed to do, replacement brushes ARE NOT expensive(16 pack for 12$ come on!) not really loud like some complain but it is after all a motorized tooth brush!!! It’s not like you are brushing for an hour. Battery works fine as it should. At its pricepoint, it’s great.",60
370,FAULTY!,1,"This toothbrush, while it does clean very well, is a complete waste of money. Ive had it less than two months and it has had battery problems since the first week. I always have it on the charger. Some days it decides to work, some days it doesnt. Just now I went to use it after it being on the charger since last nights brushing and it was completely dead. I wish I could get my money back! I even bought the combo that came with extra brush heads. Oral-B owes me money for this piece of crap.",98
371,Nice item. I have an injured arm and brushing ...,5,"I ordered my first Pro 1000 on Feb 6, I like this Oral B alot. Problem was I would get one 2 min brush a day which was suppose to be two, two minute brushes per day on one charge for the week. I am not new to electric tooth brushes and did not press to hard or do anything except follow instructions. I applied for a return that was processed quickly and another Oral B 1000 was sent out. New one on hand and I will update my review but at least Amazon was very helpful which is important at this point. I would not blame anyone for the brush except the manufacturer.",114
372,Tooth Brush,5,"This is the best toothbrush I have ever had. It is not the one with all the ""bells and whistles"" but does
an amazing job of cleaning my teeth. It may be inexpensive, but works like the more expensive ones.
Highly recommend this toothbrush.",44
373,It's sooo loud!!,3,"It's extremely loud compared to my aquasonic electric toothbrush. The brush head is not slim at all, i don't feel like it cleans on the side of the teeth as well as a slimmer brush head would. The brush doesn't clip in place, and the vibration pushes the head up causing it to be even louder! I'm not sure about this toothbrush, I tried oral b because everyone swears by it....so hmmm...I don't know :/",75
374,Brushes well but RUSTS quickly,3,"I had this tooth brush for a month. I loved it; it cleaned well. However, after only a month, I took the head off and it was all rusted underneath. I had always rinsed it off and dried the outside. Make sure you take the toothbrush head off and wash/dry that after each use as well.",56
375,"Louder than your Auntie Bobs ""screwdriver""",2,"I like the twisty action but sweet jesus. This thing should come with earplugs.. Its totally ridiculous. I like this better than the most highly rated sonicare, but i almost strictly use the sonicare. Its that bad.
Also the battery seems very much garbage riggt out of the box. Use once put back on charger and charging light blinks for about 24hrs. Took days to take initial charge.
Looks designed to fail. Has a gaint hole wher theres a spring for the action in the head Packs with paste and leaks. Def. Not as sleek as the sonicare.",98
376,Timer,1, The sound is sooo loud. And it stops in every ten seconds and then you have to reopen it for another ten seconds. Bristles like a kind of weapon in your mouth because It’s sooo hard and make me bloody every time.,42
377,Bought it twice!,5,"I forgot my previous one after a hotel stay, so I had to use a regular brush until I could afford a replacement. Well, I'm so happy to have it again! It cleans so well, and the timer reminds me to brush each quadrant equally. Brushing teeth can feel so monotonous at times, but I think this toothbrush makes it a little easier.",63
378,I love the old model!,3,"I love this rotating toothbrush over the brand that vibrates. My first one lasted for YEARS. It still works and I have gone back to using it because the one I got September 2020 is so darn difficult to turn off! They changed the on/off button to an indentation, whereas the original was a raised button which is much easier to press. You have to press for several seconds to turn it off in either model, but on the new model my thumb HURTS by the time it's finally off. Maybe I have arthritis, I don't know, but man I wish they'd return to a raised control switch.",108
379,Dental Hygienist Recommendation,5,"My dental hygienist specifically recommended this electronic toothbrush. I didn’t expect too much from it except that it could help with plaque buildup( per hygienist). But it does so much more and I love using it. My teeth feel so much cleaner after each use and my gums are healthier too. I really like the feel of the electric toothbrush. At my last professional cleaning, my hygienist told me what a difference using the Oral B had made in my oral health.",82
380,"Don't get it wet, or else!",1,"It worked for about 2 weeks before it slowly died. I contacted Braun/oral B, they said if it got wet that they wouldn't stand behind it for a warranty claim, who doesn't get their toothbrush wet! I then asked for my money back under their 60 day guarantee and told me without the original packaging and a store receipt that they couldn't help me. Fortunately, Amazon was good enough to take it back along with the extra refills that I had purchased. I had my last Phillips tooth brush for 6 years without any issue, I just bought another Phillips.",100
381,Overall very pleased with two exceptions.,4,I've used a competitor's electric tooth brush for over 20 years but this one has a much more vigorous action and cleans better. My only disappointments are that it doesn't come with a travel case and a plastic cap to protect the brush head from ambient air germs between brushings.,50
382,BAD BUY,1,"Trust me when i tell you this isn't a great decision of a purchase, wouldn't have ever expected Oral B to have made these so cheap and bad. Firstly the battery life of this brush is terrible, you need to leave it in its charger that i cant do in my bathroom, the charging is very slow and little. The brush feels really cheaply made and the brush head doesn't have a lock when put onto the brush so it can fall off, and a lot of water gets into the head part so you have to clean that out after every use or you'll get mold, also the brush head doesn't feel like its cleaning much nor very well.",120
383,Much better than the old manual toothbrush,4,"Much better than the old manual toothbrush. My teeth feel much cleaner. I'm hoping it helps prevent additional cavities.. I seem to be getting a lot more lately... My teeth and gums feel much cleaner. My dentist thought I was brushing too hard so I am hoping this will help prevent that; I have not seen the sensor come on to indicate I am brushing to hard even when I purposely press down to see if the indicator works.... I think it doesn't but regardless, it leave my mouth feeling clean and teeth look whiter.",95
384,weak charge,2,"Bought two for christmas presents. My son has the white one and i use the black. after a few weeks,we notice that the white one holds the charge longer, and even when both are fully charged, the black one spins a weaker oscillation than the white one. we compared side by side many times. same, black one is weaker. i got a lemon?",63
385,Like every other one I've had - it still stalls at a certain angle,4,I'd been using those Oral B electrics that you can get in the aisle next to the toothpaste and toothbrushes. They all stall and sputter at maybe a 45 degree angle when using them to brush. Annoying. Bought this one and it's a bit more powerful than the battery powered units but it likewise has this issue at 45 degrees while brushing where it sputters and stalls. Strange. It still works but the sputter is annoying. Well FYI. Good luck to you.,82
386,Great,4,"I really like this unit, only thing keeping it below 5 stars is the ridiculous price of replacement brush heads! I will be trying third-party brushes. Better than two previous cheap Oral-B electric toothbrushes I have had. I would not spend the money for the more expensive models with extra gimmicks. This one is too pricey itself, but I caught it on sale for $30.",65
387,$10 Tooth Brush,1,"The head on this toothbrush is huge, making it difficult to clean your back teeth/hard to reach areas. It's also pretty poor quality. The tooth brush kept shutting off randomly and I had to hit the power button again to turn it back on (not the timer function). I don't see anything about this product that justifies the high cost. Returned it after one use.",65
388,Not as described or advertised,2,"What was in the box is not the same as what is described on the outside of the box (or the product description}. While the product looks the same, there is no 2 minute timer light, and the charging and battery level lights are essentially useless. The Battery level indicator is really only a charging status light and does not show current levels. The charging light is non functional and there is no timer light as described on the box...so far it charges and it works everything else is vapor.",90
389,Good for brushing teeth but slippery,4,This product functions very well. I have only one issue with it. The shape of the handle is straight and so smooth that it is hard to grip when wet. I put a rubber band around it and can now grip it much better. I like all the other features and feel my teeth get very clean using it.,59
390,It's OK,2,Power button is inset and difficult to operate. My old Oral-B brush was heavier and easier to turn on or off.,21
391,The brush head action is great but the back of it sticks out too much,3,"I was using a sonic toothbrush prior to getting this but my dentist recommended switching to this due to sonic toothbrushes actually having been found to cause long term receding of the gum line. Overall, this was easy to set up out of the box and was able to run the duration of brushing my teeth without having to wait to charge it up all the way. I like the action of the brush head because it feels almost like the polisher when you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. My only criticism of this product also pertains to the brush head design- I have a rather small jaw with all of my wisdom and molar teeth still in, and there is a projection of the back end of the toothbrush head that sticks out just enough to hit the row of teeth above or below the ones being brushed when I try to brush all the way in the back. I have dysfunction of my TMJ so craning my mouth all the way open to get the toothbrush to fit back there is not pleasant at all. Hoping to see an improved brush head design that is compatible with this base in the future.",206
392,Plastic Irritates My Lips & Brushing Too Aggressive & Hurts Gums,2,"The plastic on the brush of this Oral-B toothbrush tastes odd & irritates my lips. Also, the brush action is too aggressive & hurts my gums. I've purchased electric toothbrushes for a very long time & I've never experienced these negative factors in any of them. Will return the product.",50
393,LOVE THIS!,5,This has made me enjoy brushing my teeth. It does a great job with cleaning my teeth & massaging my gums. I love that it’s a reasonable price and comes with a charger. It does 4 - 30 second timers so you can get all 4 quadrants of your mouth.,50
394,All you need for a toothbrush,5,"Bought myself this toothbrush after I bought one for my wife's birthday. Spinning bristles vs vibration brush heads makes a difference to get in between those hard to reach teeth. The 30 second timer for each section of your mouth isn't for everyone, but can be a useful feature.",49
395,I feel super clean,5,Love this electric toothbrush. The only time my teeth only feel this clean is when I leave the dentist. Now I get that same great feeling every day. I couldn’t be happier with how clean this tooth brush leaves my teeth.,41
396,Works Well,5,"This one is smooth and I am happy with it. Some of them are really rough. I thought the 3000 model made the difference but not so, as I have one 3000 that is rough and one that is super smooth. Besides they are expensive. Not sure what determines the smoothness of operation but this one happens to operate smoothly. The price was better than the other 1000 I have and that is why I purchased it.",77
397,It's ok,3,"We have 2 of these, I gave this 3 stars because of the strange what seems like shortage in the battery.
We are not sure exactly what it is, we can be brushing and the brush will stop very quickly and start again. It happens every single time. We feel the clean is good, but think we got 2 defective products? Haven't seen any other comments regarding the starting and stopping.

We have not had issues with the charging like some others have, although I feel it does take too long to fully charge.",94
398,"Solid ""bargain"" electric toothbrush",4,"I got this for $45, and was switching from another toothbrush namely the now defunct Oral-B Pulsonic. The Oral-B Pro 1000 is relatively slim compared with other electric tooth brushes, but definitely not as slim as the pulsonic. It has good ergonomics, easy to change heads and the fact that Oral-B has consolidated it's brush heads means it's even easier to buy the correct brush heads. One star I took away from here only because as I brush, it seems sort of loud compared to the Pulsonic (maybe it means it's more powerful?). Overall, it's been good to me. Keeps its charge so far, I seem to get about a week or so before I notice it slowing (brushing twice a day, sometimes 3)",124
399,Works well so far!,5,"So far this works great. Battery life about 7 days (brushing 2xs/day). I say 'so far' as there were quite a few 'bad reviews' siting battery charge issues. I've been using for a month. My previous OralB had a few 'bells and whistles' which are totally unnecessary. So, opted for this basic item and am liking it so far.",59
400,Extremely poor battery life,1,"This product was fine while the battery life was healthy. But, after less than one year of ownership, the battery is already incapable of holding a charge for more than 3 days of use. Ultimately, this product has proven to be a DISPOSABLE toothbrush at a high price point.",49
401,Not as good as Philips Sonicare,2,"I like that the base and brush are streamlined. Otherwise it is inferior to the former Philips brush I had. It was cheaper and that's a plus because electric brushes last perhaps 3 years, maybe a little more. I wasn't able to get heads for my prior Philips which is why I changed. The timer keeps going, so it registers every 30 seconds and never stops. I like it to stop at 2 minutes. Then I can do more if I want. Not sure it works as well. It seems much slower and only has one speed. I've had it 2 months and the writing is already flaking off. I haven't scrubbed it, I just wipe it dry after use.
I'll probably replace it before investing in new heads.",129
402,Rotary heads are the best cleaners!,5,I love this toothbrush. Rotary heads are the best. I have another brush I paid much more for but I prefer this one. It doesn't have that annoying 30 second pause and it doesn't time out. Those features are for kids and I DONT like them. Great brush! I will buy again.,52
403,Still need to go to the dentist,5,"You'll still need to go to the dentist regardless of using this brush morning and night. It is great, the heads are somewhat reasonably priced. I also floss daily as well and use a pre-rinse and after-rinse mouth wash as well. It's very well powered, and I usually go over the 2 minute recommendation. Not so great for your tongue. A metal tongue scraper goes a long way instead. Oral health has been linked to cariovascular and gut health as well, so I try to take care.",87
404,Not working as described,1,"I have had this only 7 days and have had to charge it 4 times, including the 22 hour start-up charging.. The battery is depleted in less than 4 brushings. This is not acceptable. Either it sat on the shelf too long or is defective. I have no idea about these features because they never kicked in or just didn't work. This deserves particular product deserves a Zero.",68
405,"It is an OG (original) electric toothbrush, as expected.",5,"This is very original electric toothbrush, charged wired-ly, no wireless/water charging, no bluetooth. It is basic for an electric toothbrush, but it is the best. Why would you get a brush with bluetooth that connect to an APP? First of all, how much memory space does your phone have that you can allowed yourself to download an extra app that is filled with ads? And do you really need an app to tell you that you forgot to brush your teeth in the morning? Do you really need an app to ......? Think about it. OG electric toothbrush is all you need.",102
406,Great!,5,"I bought these for my husband and I after our dentist recommended that an electric toothbrush was the way to go - and I am SO GLAD that we switched!! I have never had such clean feeling teeth after a brush than I have with these and will NEVER go back to a manual brush. We have sinced switch our sons to them as well - and they are getting positive feedback from their dentist as well. They may not have every ""extra"" all these other brands and kinds offer - but seriously - why do you need them?? Worth every cent - and recommend highly!",106
407,It's a really good tooth brush!!,5,"I've had my new toothbrush for over 2 months now, and I love it. I've had Oral B brushes for years, but this time I got the one that signaled when to move to the next quadrant in my mouth. I've discovered that I was over brushing some parts of my mouth and barely noticing other parts of my mouth during my 2 minute brush. It takes some adjustment, but it is exactly what I wanted. If you don't want the gentle reminder to brush your teeth in quadrants, then you can either ignore the reminders, or buy a cheaper tooth brush since those reminders come with a price tag.",110
408,Low Battery Life,2,"I've used Oral-B in the past without fail. I've had this toothbrush for about a month, and the charge seems to be fading. After a full charge, I got around 3 days of brushing twice a day. Now after a full charge, it starts flashing red to recharge after only a few uses. I could get a solid week on the older models. Not sure if it's defective or the norm for these new models.",75
409,Ok for a cheap electric toothbrush,3,"I’ll stick with my Sonicare. Thought I’d try the Oral-b because of all the great reviews, but I’m somewhat disappointed. It feels like it cleans my teeth ok, but it’s loud and rattles. Cheaply made, but I guess I got what I paid for.",44
410,Nice... 1.5 year review.,2,"I would like to give this more stars but after 1.5 years my battery wont hold a charge. Other than that, it did what is expected. Cleans great, the time sensor is cool, and my dentist noticed the difference. However, the battery only lasting 1.5 years with 2x a day use minimum..

I will be buying another electric toothbrush, maybe try a sonic this time.

hope this helps",68
411,DO NOT BUY,2,I'm a dentist and I wanted to buy a toothbrush as a present. I read all the reviews and decided on this one. I hate it. 1) It is huge. The head is so big it cannot get to those hard to reach spots in a mouth. 2) The head doesn't properly attach to the body of the brush so the head can come off into the mouth at any time. Awful product. Do not waste your time and money.,80
412,Best toothbrush purchase I’ve ever made,5,Where have I been? I’ve been missing out in having an electric toothbrush. It’s awesome and precise. I’m not sure about the timer though I haven’t noticed that feature. I keep mine charged up and no complaints so far. Great value for the price,44
413,Awful batteries. Not replaceable,2,"Good toothbrush overall, but batteries are awful.
After a year of usage they hold less and less charge, need to be recharged more and more often.

And now, less than 2 years later, hardlyworks for 2 days and needs recharge.

By not making the batteries replaceable they force us to buy more often, and create more garbage.
No doubt that it is done intentionally.",64
414,Terrible toothbrush,1,"I'm wondering if the positive reviewers have ever used any other electric toothbrush. This was the worst one I've ever tried. Feels cheap and clumsy, vibrates all over the place and is also quite noisy. I suppose with electric toothbrushes, you get what you pay for. I paid a little more to replace this garbage and got a much better product. Using this Oral-B convinced me to switch to a Phillips Sonic Care toothbrush. I'm glad I did, because they are far superior to Oral-B in my opinion.",88
415,Great gift!,5,I gifted this to my husband to replace his old electric toothbrush. He loves the power to clean and easy use to brush his teeth. Priced well!,27
416,Tore up my gums,1,"The brush head is too large, and I had trouble fitting it into the back of my mouth, between my teeth and my cheeks. It was also difficult trying to brush my teeth on the lingual side. The bristles are way too firm and tore up my gums, on the edge where they meet my teeth. It is also very loud. I'm going to just stick with my Phillips Sonicare.",70
417,i have very sensitive gums that bleed no matter how ...,5,"i have very sensitive gums that bleed no matter how much i floss. i was worried that the brush head that came with this would be too rough, but i have been using it for two days and so far, it hasn't made me bleed! i get tarter buildup in between my front bottom teeth, and my dentist suggested that i try a battery powered toothbrush to get more of it out in between cleanings. time will tell if this helps with that or not, but i am loving it so far. the charger base is a little bit of an awkward fit with the brush, which is the only downside i have found about this so far.",118
418,Good results!,4,I love Oral-B brand electric toothbrush more than the other popular one because of the compact head. I have used both and think that Oral-B size is best for me. This is a replacement brush for an old one that lasted for 15 years! It just got weaker and weaker but didn't die! I decided it was high time to treat myself to a new toothbrush. The only thing with this model versus my old one was the on/off button - I find it difficult to feel when I'm trying to turn it off. Other than that - I love it!,101
419,Pretty loud but good,4,"4 stars just because it’s pretty loud. It’s jarring when you’re really tired and need to brush your teeth and all you hear is BUZZZZZZZZZZUZUZUZUZUZUZUUZUZ
But it does what it’s supposed to, my teeth feel so clean after and the timer function is nice",44
420,"I liked the Oral-B Black Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, but....",4,"I would like to say that I found this experience really interesting and I like the product, but I feel as thought the brush head is a bit small. I enjoyed the serious sonic vibrations and it must have been doing a good job, but I had no idea my gums were going to begin bleeding for the first 3 times I used it. I checked with my dentist and she said my teeth look great and my gums are healthy so it could be that it takes a couple of times for your teeth and gums to get used to it. This too shall pass. Thank you for the experience.",111
421,Toothbrush died in 6 months and doesn’t charge anymore,1,I have used electric toothbrushes for over a decade and have enjoyed Oral B product. After losing my last toothbrush on a trip I purchased this identical type in June 2021. As of December 2021 the toothbrush doesn’t charge and turn on. I have changed the charging station and it still doesn’t function. It’s disappointing to have to repurchase another electric toothbrush less than 6 months.,66
422,Amazing. Exactly what I needed,5,Bought mine in 2018 and it has worked perfectly. Mouth felt clean. Brush heads are inexpensive and effective. Stays charged for about a week before needing another. Just a great product. After three years it stopped charging. Figuring out if I need a total replacement or just a battery of some kind.,52
423,Good value but SO LOUD,3,"I want to review this higher because it feels like good build quality and the charger works well and it does a great job brushing. But it's so so loud, to the point where you can still hear it from the bedroom down the hall with both the bathroom door and bedroom door closed. As I find myself brushing late at night, this is not ideal.",66
424,doesn't hold a charge well.,3,"delivred promptly, works well except for rechargable battery. does not seem to hold a charge for more than 10'ish days @2x per day (mostly). definite difference from when fully charged to a few days later. i expected better.",38
425,How to order more brush head,5,"I only had this toothbrush for only 3 months, so far I like this product.very much. I haven’t got a chance to have my annual dental check up yet, but every time after brushing, my mouth feels so clean and fresh. Only one thing, only one toothbrush head was included in this order, now I would like to know how can I order more brush head ? Can you give me the right item # ? I don’t want to order the wrong kind. Thank you",86
426,AGRADECIDO!,4,"No tiene conectividad Bluetooth que yo sepa. El modelo es pro 1000. En todo caso, el manual no dice mucho, ni hay sitio donde buscar rápido en español de la internet. Buena limpieza profunda con cabezales originales no con imitaciones. El temporizador no funcionó y la Compañía, me envió uno nuevo el cual aún no he probado ya que estoy fuera del país. Cuando lo pruebe, lo diré, pero aprecio la prontitud y esmero de la Compañía de satisfacer al cliente. Eso ganó mi confianza y lealtad a la marca",90
427,Excellent product with one qualm,4,Works very well. One complaint. They programmed in a stutter on the motor every 30 seconds. I guess it was cheaper than a pressure sensor.,25
428,On/off switch very difficult to use while brushing.,1,Location and texture of on/off switch make it very difficult to find while brushing. This is a serious design flaw and a good reason not to buy this product. Update 04/08/2021 have discontinued using this product. Brush design causes gum bleeding. Have returned to soft hand toothbrushes with no problems.,50
429,Be AWARE of their packaging options!!!!!,3,"Disregarding the product itself, the tooth brush is amazing! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

However I was disappointed and actually not happy that the package was not well packed into an Amazon box at all. Found my exposed toothbrush box directly waiting for me in my mailbox. I looked online and states that we have the options of want to have it shipped in a box or not. In the desktop version it showed and states those options. For mobile app version, does not and was not well aware I had a choice. As a loyal amazon customer, this was new for me. I just thank goodness my toothbrush came in safe and sound without it being stolen or tampered.",116
430,A peice of plastic that has a spinning brush on the end. Super faaaawncy.,4,"Overall, this toothbrush is great. It cleans my teeth well and the battery lasts a long time. The reason I docked a star is because I can barely tell the pressure sensor is there at all. The 7000 Series one really warns you. This ones barely slows down at all, so I basically can't tell when it's active at all. Maybe mine is defective. Other features of both the 1000 and 7000 series, I don't care about. I like the rotate-y oscillate-y bit, and I'd like to know when I'm pressing too hard. That's it.",95
431,Love it!!!,5,"This product is amazing, I can’t believe I waited so long to buy one. My teeth feel so clean and polished after ever cleaning. It’s 100% better than a regular toothbrush and worth every penny. You have to use it differently than you do a toothbrush, you just let it do the brushing. I love how clean my teeth feels after.",61
432,Your Teeth will feel extra clean.....,5,It does what it says and says what it does...my teeth look spectacular...cleans the gum line and then some. I would highly recommend getting this electronic toothbrush the Oral-B Pro 1000. Simple to use and setup...I went on YouTube to see how to use and electronic toothbrush which really helped me out.,52
433,Would Not Recommend,2,Would not recommend for deep cleaning. Not enough functions for the price. There are a lot of good budget toothbrushes that are better than this one outside of Oral B. I like the Oral B brand but definitely not this unit May be okay for someone to wants to see how an electric toothbrush is used. That's about it. Does not last long.,63
434,"Loud, uncomfortable, and difficult to use",1,This toothbrush vibrates so much that it causes the toothpaste to drip out of my mouth because the vibrations are so much. And it makes my hand feel funny from holding it because of the vibrations. On top of that it’s super loud. And the toothpaste drips down the toothbrush because of how much it vibrates. It is hard to keep toothpaste in your mouth with this toothbrush. It makes your whole face numb from vibration. I highly recommend that you do not buy this toothbrush.,86
435,"Large handle, large plaque removal",2,"Bought after reading a review from The Sweethome. IT pulses super hard and gets all the stuff between your teeth. Also replacement heads are super easy to find. The handle is a bit big and clunky. The timer is awesome since it switches every 30 seconds.

UPDATE:
The large handle made me not use it. It sat collecting dust. Threw it away and got a sonicare",66
436,"Reliable, long battery life and cleans great!",5,For the price this is a good electric toothbrush that's reliable and has excellent battery life. It's compatible with all the Oral B heads so you can change and adjust to how you want to clean. It gets the job done. This is my second one as the first one stopped charging after almost 6 years of daily use.,59
437,Clean teeth and all the functions I needed,5,"I love it. Simple timer, nice charger, battery low flashing lights and holds a good charge. I am mot sure why I would need more functions. My gums were sore at first but I watched a video tutorial online on how to use it properly (do not use the same technique like a regular tooth brush) and after about a week I got used to electronic brushing! My teeth feel much cleaner and was complimented on my brushing by my oral hygienist. I would recommend others to purchase this.",89
438,Great toothbrush!,5,Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was her first time using an electric toothbrush and she can’t express how much better it is. The spin is really nice and feels nice and sturdy. Timer is a plus. Definitely don’t need a $100+ one. This one works just as well.,54
439,THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VIBRATOR,2,"So, definitely returned this product. BECAUSE, the vibration on this thing is RIDICULOUS. I turned it on and I was like "" Ooohhh Laawwwddd"". It is INTENSE. Idk who in their right mind designed the intensity of the vibration for this toothbrush but they were obviously thinking of something else than the mouth. This will leave your gums bleeding. It is like power wash for the driveway.",67
440,Great toothbrush,5,I have had an one of these for more than 5 years and just ordered this for my wife. I wouldn’t buy any other tooth brush. Leaves your mouth feeling much cleaner than a regular toothbrush. The timer has changed my brushing habits completely. It gives you a signal every 30 seconds to change to a different “quadrant” of your mouth. I honestly think the guilt I have from cutting the timer short has forced me to brush more thoroughly for the full two minutes.,85
441,Great toothbrush,5,Love this toothbrush. My dentist even commented that my gums were in better shape this checkup than last. It has been around 6 months that I have used this toothbrush and it is doing the job. I especially like the vibration for 30 second intervals so I can change from one quadrant of my teeth to another. I leave it in the charger after each use and it has plenty of charge to last the 2-3 minutes I use it. Will buy again if I ever need to.,88
442,Oral B Toothbrush Excellent Choice,5,I had an Oral B electric toothbrush for about 12 years. This was the upscale version that retailed for about $125. Found this less expensive version on Amazon and it is more powerful than my original Oral B. Love it.,40
443,Would definitely recommend!,5,So far I really enjoy this brush! I had the cheaper one that uses batteries. I really enjoyed it and just replaced when needed and used it for years. This one is awesome and I really enjoy the charger. It makes it so much more convenient. And the power of the brush is amazing. It is much cheaper over all to get this one and the replacement brush heads. Then the battery one where you would just have to buy a whole new toothbrush and more batteries. Would definitely recommend!,90
444,Great buy! Super clean teeth!,5,"Wow!!! I have been putting off purchasing an electric brush because they are costly. But I have been really missing out. My teeth have never felt so clean and buffed after a brush. This really gets down into the crevices and isn’t hard on gums. Some people complained about to timing indicator, but I like it. With my manual brush I found myself spending more time in one area than the others, so the pulsing timer on this one is very beneficial for me personally. I’ve had it for about two weeks now and haven’t found anything to complain about.",100
445,A fine replacement for our 20-year old Oral-B electric toothbrush,5,"Our old toothbrush finally gave up the ghost. The on/off switch sort of wore out. The new machine functions just fine. I have no earthly use for the ""timer function"" - I know how (long) to brush my teeth.",39
446,"Loud and less thorough, going back to Sonicare.",3,"I used a sonicare for years, then bought this one because I no longer wanted to share the sonicare with my husband. I liked the idea that the Oral-B brush was round - seemed like it would get in various angled spots better. After using it six months, I have now bought my own new sonicare and thrown the Oral B away. The Oral-B is so loud. So loud. And I didn’t feel like the brushing action was as thorough.",80
447,... tried the more expensive Oral B product and I love this one the best,4,"I've tried the more expensive Oral B product and I love this one the best because

-price
-performance is as good as the $200

PURCHASED my 1st One on 03/17/2017 and the battery is dead on 08/03/2018 Good Product but the battery life terrible. It has a two year manufacture warranty and I've shipped it out for repair but it's been more than a month and I've never heard back from them.

Purchased my 2nd one 09/16/2018 - Their warranty is terrible. It's been more than 40 Days since I've shipped my first order for repair and I've never heard back from Oral B. Decided to purchase another one.",109
448,Buy it!,5,"My dentist recommended this after I told him I didn't want to buy the $100 version and it gets my teeth so clean! I got one for my dad too and he usually destroys toothbrushes but the bristles have held up pretty well so far (2 months). The 30 second timer is nice. Battery lasts a long time (maybe a week?). My only complaint is that I thought it had something that would alert you if you pressed too hard but it doesn't. I don't have an issue with it though, it seems like I don't need to press very hard to clean my teeth",105
449,Charging issues,3,The toothbrush does do an overall well job of cleaning the teeth I have had it for about three months however now my battery life is horrible. I have to use a regular toothbrush because it will die mid teeth cleaning. It’s really inconvenient and annoying and I keep it on the charger so I don’t understand. My sister has a different Phillips brush and doesn’t have any issues with charging for hers.,73
450,Wonderful,5,"I have always had areas that are hard to clean, but not anymore with the oral-b 1000 every area and every tooth gets magical clean. This is probably the best product I’ve ever bought for the money.

I do find the time a tad annoying but I can live with it.

Great product.",53
451,Way too loud. No thanks,2,"I bought this when my sonicare pooped out on me. My family all uses this brand so I thought, ""well I better get on the same page!""
I regret it. It's so loud, and my sister walked by and said ""I thought you were shaving your face in there!"" Like no, a toothbrush shouldn't sound like an electric razor. Haha

It cleans fine, and I like the round brush head but I'm petty and the sound did me in. I will be going back to sonicare.",86
452,This is a good product.,5,"This product cleans reliably and very well, when used properly. The battery charge lasts about a week if you use it two or 3 times a day, and I recommend letting the battery run all the way down before a constant 15-hour charge. Most electric toothbrushes lose power after a short time and require frequent recharging which shortens battery life. This one is very good and the brush-heads, while expensive, are easily found in most drug stores or Wal*Marts. It does what it's supposed to do and performs admirably compared to similar products. I strongly recommend it.",97
453,Great basic electric toothbrush,5,This is my second purchase of this model. The first lasted a very long time and was still going fine but slowing a bit when I bought a new one. I don't need all the bells and whistles of very expensive models and just want a well-functioning electric toothbrush that gets your teeth clean. I think this is a great choice for the price.,64
454,Life changing,5,I had been considering getting an electric toothbrush for quite a while based on dentist recommendations and knowing that it would probably do a better job than I do manually. Whatever reservations I had were unwarranted. The price if this model is quite reasonable and it is a pleasure to use. Brushing my teeth requires less effort and my teeth have never felt so clean.,65
455,Doesn't remove tartar/plaque,1,"After my 20 year old Sonicare died, I went to Amazon for a replacement. Based on reviews & comparisons, I chose this Oral-B. I have had no cavities, tartar or plaque build up in 20 years.
Two weeks ago at my bi-annual hygienist/dentist appointment, they wanted to know what happened!?! While I still had no cavity, the extreme increase in tartar/plaque build-up was noticeable.
I bought a new Sonicare. Now I'm hoping to get a refund on this POS, Oral-B.",80
456,basic and works great,5,"I have used this same toothbrush for several years now on my dental hygienist's recommendation, with the sensitive heads, and it's greatly improved my dental checkups. I had the toothbrush in an ugly blue color and was excited to find it here for the same price I paid in a much more attractive black and white model. Great toothbrush for those who want a quality electric toothbrush but don't want or need a lot of extra features like bluetooth connectivity and such.",82
457,Best brush to date,5,"Best brush I've had in a while but also my first electrical brush... I have periodontal Disease so I suffer from receding bleeding gums and sensitive teeth but this brush definitely helped with all that, I almost never bleed and my teeth are much stronger now!",46
458,It trains you to brush better.,5,I've had two Oral B toothbrushes in the past. They keep getting better! This one times your four quadrants of your teeth to make sure you devote equal time to all of your teeth. It also makes sure you are not applying too much pressure when you brush.,48
459,Good tooth brush,4,The only thing I do not like about this series of a toothbrush is that they need to put the grip back onto the brush it’s very slippery when you’re brushing your teeth and water gets on it.,38
460,"Braun is excellent quality, will last years",5,"Simple, no features but it’s super powerful. So little effort to brush. Mouth feels amazing after and so clean! My last 2 oral b electric brushes lasted about 10 yrs each and they were great. Battery was starting not to hold charge so bought this one and so glad I did! Haven’t had a cavity in years and my dentist always compliments my brushing. Excellent quality!",66
461,"Rattles, clunky, noisy",3,"My last Braun electric toothbrush was much “smoother” in vibration. Maybe something is wrong with this one? In stead of brushing my teeth clean, it feels like it is trying to shake everything loose! Wondering if I should have gone with a Sonicare?",43
462,Overall: Great,4,"I enjoy this toothbrush a lot. It offers a deep clean and is easy to use. It does take a long time to charge if you let the battery run out completely, so I recommend leaving it on the charger when not in use. My only complaint is that they advertise it having 3 different settings you can change it to, but I’ve followed the instructions and made multiple attempts and it appears it really only has one function, Daily Cleanse (or whatever it’s called). Not a big problem, but the false advertising is suspicious.",95
463,Nice dependable toothbrush,5,This is a no frills nor features electric toothbrush. But it does its job VERY well. It is a little louder than other models but nothing that stops me from using it. I use it with sensitive heads and just move it over my teeth and let it do all the work.,52
464,Leaves My Teeth Nice and Clean,4,"This Oral-B is replacing one that I had for over 20 years. This toothbrush is much better, some principle on how they operate, but my teeth feel cleaner with this new toothbrush, especially around the gum line. It took about 18 hours to completely charge the toothbrush. I like that the handle is thinner than my old Oral-B. The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 stars is my old Oral-B had a place in the charging unit to store the cord & plug; it's a nice feature and this Oral-B doesn't have that feature. Bottom line ........... love it and would recommend it.",105
465,I don't understand why these products do not have better batteries. With this new one,3,"This new Pro 1000 seems to be more powerful than my old one. I bought a new one because my old one will only hold a charge for two brushing's if not on the charger. I don't understand why these products do not have better batteries. With this new one, after about the third use I find it is slowing down. I can get a few more uses but the power is really reduced. It works best if left on the charger every day. All of the electric razors I have had over the last 15 years have had batteries that would last for as much as two weeks or more of daily use before needing a charge. I like the operation of the unit but battery life is minimal.",130
466,Corta batería y problemas de cargador,2,"No es el mejor que he tenido. La batería dura muy poco y dura muchísimo para cargar por completo, además el cargador tiene problemas con los enchufes. Al principio puede parecer muy duro y lastimar un poco las encías. También, los respues son un tanto costos.",46
467,Disappointing,3,"I've had several Braun electric toothbrushes, and this is not the same quality as the others. The power button is small and awkward to use, indented rather than raised. Also the rotating speed is quite slow.",36
468,Good toothbrush,5,"So, around the time toothbrushes gained bluetooth connectivity, I began to be confused about the many features now available in (what should be) a very simple tool. This is a good toothbrush. My dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth and they feel good and clean. Which is all I'm looking for in a toothbrush so I'm quite pleased.",61
469,No help from Oral B,1,Don't buy. If you go slightly past Amazon return policy they won't stand behind their product. This item will not hold a charge. They want me to send it in for repair. What are we supposed to use while they work on it? I can get a refund if I send it back at our cost. No thank you. No more Oral B for us.,65
470,good clean teeth!,5,"It arrived quickly, was not a problem figuring out how it works, and cleans my teeth 10x better than my previous electric toothbrush. The small head and twisting motion make it much easier to get into close spaces, and the timer works great. It was a small thing, I know, but my previous brush just shut off at the end of the 2 minutes ... this one lets you know with a different type of pause, but keeps going. It's not annoying like my last one was. Highly recommended.",89
471,This tooth brush never worked at all !,1,"I have used this tooth brush brand for many years and this is the first time I have ever had a problem..... I would like to exchange it for one that works... I talked t o Amazon on line help ,,, and there were not so much help at all. 'Told me to phone the Oral B people my self... @ 1-800-566-7252. Sorry to say I waited a long time , and finally gave up because my husband wanted dinner.",80
472,Battery does not charge,1,"I received this product and really enjoyed the toothbrush. The one thing that I really dislike about this product is that it does not keep a charge. I had to charge 24/7 to even be able to use it for one brush session. I think this is a major turn off for this product. I even had a replacement toothbrush come because I thought maybe my product was defected, but the new toothbrush was exactly the same way. I want an electric toothbrush that will keep a charge and this is not the one.",94
473,Doesn’t clean very well,2,This toothbrush doesn’t leave my teeth feeling very clean. I think the bristles are too soft. Am on a trip and brought a regular toothbrush and my teeth feel freshly polished. Don’t waste your money.,35
474,Does a great job. Worth the $40,5,Had an older oral b electric brush that was still working but my girlfriend bought this one and was going on about how great it is so I tried it out and it works really well. My teeth feel like they just had a cleaning but the brush isn't so tough that my gums hurt. Worth the $40. Hope it lasts as long as my old brush did.,68
475,love it,5,I have been using a regular toothbrush since my last electric one was dead. I didn't realize how much cleaner my teeth are after just a few days and noticeably whiter. I will never go without a electric toothbrush again. I really like this one and is reasonably priced.,49
476,Cleans the spaces that a regular tooth brush can't,5,"This electric tooth brush works fantastic. For my daily routine, I brush my teeth two to three times with a normal toothbrush, followed by the electric brush once a day. My gums can only handle using this product once a day, but it makes my teeth feel and look great! Definitely recommend buying.",53
477,Too noisey. Had to return.,2,"Seem to work OK, but was way noisier then expected.",10
478,Too large a product for me,1,Unfortunately this product did not work for me due to the size of this product. It simply was too big for me. I am an adult but I tried for days to use this but it simply was so big for me that it was a mess. My teeth felt clean and fresh but I could not close my mouth with the brush in it! So you can imagine how it was after brushing for 2 minutes and trying to keep my chin and hand dry! Hopefully I can find another product.,92
479,Don’t buy!,1,"Never wrote a review before but here goes. This product is not from America, it’s very cheaply made. I bought another one by the same manufacturer, Oral-B and it was fine this one is not the same. It does say eligible for return but now that I wanna return it it says not eligible for return.",56
480,Good value. All brush heads fit this.,5,"Just the basics. I don't need all the other things that come with the more expensive models. This is my second Oral-B, the other one lasted over 10 years. I did some research and found that the cross action head was a bit softer than the precision clean heads I have been using. I find this to be a nice change. The cross action is the most advanced plaque remover at this time. I am brushing longer due to the better comfort. Since all brush heads fit all models, you can get the lesser expensive brush and base and just purchase the brush head you like or need.",108
481,Great While It Lasted,3,"This was a great toothbrush - easy to use, only needed to be charge once each week (although that usually took 2 days to complete). I have no issues with it, except that it only lasted about 10 months. Now it says it's charged, but it won't turn on. Disappointing, since my old Sonicare lasted for about 5 years.

I will likely stick with Oral B, because the brush heads fit my mouth better. But I'll be looking for a model with a better life cycle.",86
482,Powerful brushing without damaging teeth,4,"This Oral-B toothbrush is more powerful than my last. It works well, is easy to hold (I have somewhat small hands), and operates effectively. It needs to be recharged fairly often (7-10 days using it 2x/day) and it seems to take longer to charge than my old model but that's not a big inconvenience.",54
483,Battery doesn't last long enough for me to brush my teeth for longer than 45 seconds,1,"I ordered this toothbrush because my sister has been using the same one for the past couple months and has been enjoying it.

The toothbrush arrived well packaged--it looks like an authentic Oral-B Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. I placed it on the charger for a full weekend before I used it for the first time. It worked well for about a week and a half. My mouth felt clean. After that it started dying quicker and quicker. I leave it on the charger at all times when it is not in use. If I change it for a full 24 hours then it will last for almost 2 minutes before dying. If I want to use it twice a day (you know... normal tooth brushing) then it will only last for about 45 seconds before completely running out of battery and need to be charged again.

I don't know if I got a defective product or what, but at this point I just went back to my regular manual toothbrush. It was a waste of money.",175
484,Cleans really well,5,Cleans great! I love the pressure indicator to alert me if I brush too hard. The gentle vibration that aids in the removal of plaque and stain. The timer keeps you aware of how long you brush. My teeth feel super clean after you brush. Great buy!,47
485,Not very deep clean,2,This toothbrush is almost an equivalent to the vibrating toothbrushes; there’s no difference in the effectiveness. The bristles turn but they’re SO LOUD i suggest purchasing one of the $100 nicer ones.,32
486,Great brush without any unnecessary add ons.,5,"This toothbrush works great. The tiny head makes it easy to get into the corners of your mouth and to make sure that you are cleaning every tooth every time. The timer is simple but effective. There are no different modes on this brush but I see that as an unnecessary addition to an electric toothbrush. I use my toothbrush to do one thing: clean my teeth, and a single mode works just fine for that.",76
487,Electric is the way to go!!!,4,"It's a little loud and felt rougher on my teeth than I would like. Maybe I need softer bristles. Overall, my teeths never felt cleaner, there's a 30sec timer that pulses through the brush to make sure u spend the proper time on sections of ur teeth",47
488,Charge too often.,4,"It looses the charge very easily. I have to full charge every 4 days, otherwise it looks the power and don’t do the job well. The description say to charge once a month, but it is not true.",38
489,Better than Sonicare!,5,I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for over 8 years. I always seemed to have a few areas that were never clean and I decided to try something different. I am very pleased with this Oral B toothbrush. My teeth feel almost as clean as going to the dentist. I like and use the timer feature. I will probably purchase a more expensive Oral B with this one quits because the batteries needs recharging frequently.,75
490,"Yes, buy it.",5,"This is great. The combination of the angled bristles and the dual action brush make you feel the cleaning action as soon as you start using it. I bought this one for my wife and she was so happy with is she told me I just had to get one, so I did. It pulses every 15 seconds to remind you to move to the next area of your mouth. I have adopted the 4 areas suggested in the manual and the technique works well. I bought this after some research and found this particular brush to be reliable and have the best cleaning action. That's all we wanted, and that is what we received. Well worth the money.",119
491,Works great,5,"No clue what Bluetooth or timer function has to do with an electric toothbrush. Bought this to replace the one I forgot at my sister’s house when on vacation. Works great & the brush head feels a little stiffer than my others, which I like.",45
492,Buy it,5,"Always used a regular toothbrush, could never find one that cleaned well enough. I could always scrap something off my teeth with my fingernail.

This thing is about as good as a dentist visit, the little timer buzz is a nice bonus. I have 6 months until the next dentist visit, if there is no edit it’s because there is nothing wrong.",62
493,Save your money,1,"I read that this was one of the most popular brushes on Amazon. It’s a major downgrade from Sonicare, but I liked the idea of a round brush, and wanted to try it. It’s awkward and clunky in your mouth, doesn’t stop after two minutes, only offers one way to brush your teeth, and its so loud. Wish I hadn’t thrown out the box, or I’d return it.",68
494,DO NOT BUY - THIS IS JUNK,1,"Received toothbrush on October 28, 2020 - as of yesterday it does not work. Less than 2 months of use? It is junk.

I have always bought sonicare toothbrushes and purchased new ones about every 18 months - when they start to get kind of yucky. I took a chance on an oral-B. Never again. If you want a toothbrush that lasts longer than 60 days - do not buy this toothbrush.",72
495,My Dentist Recommended This,5,"This is my second electric toothbrush by Braun (the first one lasted 11 years!). I get high ratings from my dental hygienist for my teeth being clean. And I like the ""timer"" (short buzz) feature that lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth. Well made and works well.",55
496,Battery failure after 5 months,1,"I’ve had the same Oral b toothbrush for over 3 years and after the battery needed charging every 4 days instead of 7, I decided to buy another. It is the same model as I purchased 3 years ago so I figured it would be fine. After 4 months, the battery of the new brush started to lose its power, slow down and barely run after the second day of a full charge. It would stop and also seemed like an issue with the button switch as well. Very dissatisfied with this brush and now it’s too late to return. I’ve read other comments on this brush saying there is a 2 year warranty, but I will need to figure out how to utilize this warranty.",126
497,"Good brush, bad pressure sensor",2,"I purchased two of these, one for my wife and one for me. We chose this model because of its pressure sensor: according to the description on the site: ""The pressure sensor stops the pulsation movement if you brush too hard"".
Well, the pressure sensor does not noticeably stop anything. Tried to apply pressure several times, and the brush continues to operate, possibly a bit slower. The user manual says that ""If too much pressure is applied, the movement of the brush head will continue but the pulsation will stop."" Hmmmm. Just keeps on going when detecting pressure.
The site is misleading.
Disappointing.",103
498,Battery stopped charging after 1 use,1,"Stopped charging after 1 use. Left it on charger for a few days, tried to use again, died on me. Did not hold a charge. Also, I received an older model toothbrush than what I ordered- Returning this toothbrush, not worth the $$",43
499,Better brush head than Sonicare.,5,I've tried both Sonicare and oral-b. The Sonicare is just a regular toothbrush that vibrates. The Oral-B brush head contours to your teeth and it brushes in little circles which is recommended by dentists. I had my upper wisdom teeth removed. Oral b brush can clean the edges of my teeth next to jaw.,54
500,Works well,4,"Does what it suppose to do. I switched from Sonic brush and like this one. It is basic, but reliable and works well. It makes quite a noise compared to the sonic one, but it gets into the tight places and cleans well there. During charging make sure and place it in the right direction, otherwise, you will waste plenty of time and it will be dead.",67
501,Dentist Clean!!,5,"This toothbrush is worth every cent! This is my first electric toothbrush and I have to say WOW! I never knew it cleaned your teeth so good. I never believed it could clean any better than manual and that it was just over rated. I was so wrong. My mouth truly feels dentist clean! If you have never tried a electric toothbrush like myself and are even slightly considering trying one, Buy this now! You won’t regret it! My dentist has Oral-B displays all over her office, so I knew this is the brand she would recommend. And I’m glad I went with it! You will be too.",108
502,Gets the job done but without the finesse.,4,"It gets your teeth cleaned. Is it louder than Sonicare? Yes. Does the handle vibrate more? Yes. Is it more difficult to clean? Yes. Does the charging station build up residue while the Sonicare one does not? Yes. Do I still use this toothbrush on a daily basis and enjoy it everytime? Yes. Frankly, if the concerns I brought up don't trouble you then buy Oral-B. If you have a tad more disposable income to toss at a toothbrush then earnestly consider Sonicare instead.",84
503,Durable battery and efficient cleaning!,5,"Loved this product! It is my first time using an electric toothbrush and I am more than satisfied with it. The battery can last up to a week and it only takes a couple minutes for me to brush now. I think it is important that I point this out, it lets you know when the battery is low. I have a trimmer for my beard that doesn't warn me when the battery is low and it has died out mid shave (a little of an inconvenience I know) but this product does. Would recommend for anyone looking for a reliable electric brush!",103
504,Sacrificing quietness with a powerful motor,5,I used an electric Oral B brush before and was quite pleased with the switch from manual to electric. Now from going to a lower end electric toothbrush to the Pro1000 was a noticeable difference. It has a powerful motor but tends to be more on the noisy side. Other than the noise level I'm very happy with this toothbrush!,60
505,Great Buy!,5,"Great product! I had the cheaper version and decided to upgrade! This one is much better with a much stronger battery life. The cheaper one you have to charge every 3 days, but these will last at least a week. I keep it on the charger at home, but it’s great being able to travel and leave the charger at home.",61
506,Great replacement,5,I had an older model of this type of toothbrush which I replaced due to the battery no longer lasting very long. I had this brush for years. I waned the same type of brush and found this one. I love it. I use it at least twice a day and some times more if needed.,56
507,Great toothbrush. Would buy again.,4,"Love this product. Just annoying sometimes when it's fully charge but battery last for a week rather than 10 days as said. I toke one star off for that.

And toothbrush if not cleaned regularly builds up toothpaste crust. Even after rinsing well.

For the price it's great and an affordable toothbrush to decrease plaque buildup and preventing gingivitis.",59
508,Only lasted 4 months,1,"Dont waste your time or money on this.... To start off this toothbrush only lasted 4 months before deciding to act like my ex-wife and just stop working. Sounds like that pretty typical for toothbrush (must be made in south jersey). With that said, similar to the ex I wont be missing this toothbrush. This toothbrush was loud... neighbors call the cops in fear of domestic situation loud.... Dont expect to come home from a long night at the bar with Joe, and not expect to wake the family with this toothbrush (I know what you're thinking - I can handle my liquor thank you - its definitively the toothbrush that woke them and not the stumbling). ANYWHO.... dont get this toothbrush. It will leave you sad, alone, and down $50 that you could have taken to the race track.",140
509,It's worth it but it takes forever to charge.,5,"It's like going to the dentist for a cleaning everyday. It's SO worth it. I should've gotten this years ago. Only weird part is, it's always blinking when charging. The instructions does say it takes 22hours to charge when battery is low, and it'll last the whole week (depends on usage). I've disconnected the charger after 24hours of charging and I assume it's fully charged. It's been 3 days now, and it hasn't indicated it needs to be charged yet.",80
510,"good tooth brush, short battery live",5,I have had oral-b electric tooth brushes since years and 15 years ago the battery would last like a month with 3 daily uses. Now it doesn't even last three days before you have to recharge. Not sure why they changed those good batteries for these small ones or if the 3d function uses so much battery that they can't help it. For everything else the brush is fine.,69
511,Fresh,4,I recently got braces so i decided to get an electric toothbrush it does make it easier to brush teeth & cleans good. I took a star away because it does not have the pressure sensor that tells you if you are brushing to hard also it takes forever to charge.,51
512,Zero battery life!!,2,Very disappointed!!!!!! I have had this product for a month. And every 3 days the battery is about to go out. The battery life on a new toothbrush should last longer than 3 days fully charged. This is my third oral B product. I have had other toothbrush prior that battery would last 1week or more without a charge. Now I’m trying to decide if I should buy another brand or what to do?????,74
513,I turned from mechanical to e toothbrush and it is very comfortable and tooth feel very fresh,5,"The Oral-B Pro 1000 is incredibly simple to operate. A single power button is located on the front face of the handle.

Pressing the button turns your electric toothbrush on or off. That’s it. It’s that simple.

The entire blue colored section of the handle is a rubber grip. Whether your fingers are wet or dry, this grip is very sticky. So much so that when I dried the handle with a towel, little pieces of fluff would stick to it.

But the rubber grip serves its purpose and allows the toothbrush to be held by even the clumsiest of hands.",101
514,Great customer service,4,"I hope there are no issues with this brush, after the 15-20 minutes this replacement brush is charging. I can't wait to use it tonight and not have to put a brush head on my Fiances brush.

I seem to have an issue with my brush I purchased. Great customer service they are sending a replacement, so I will give them 4 stars to start. I am having troubles with my unint charging. There is no indication that it is charging and there is no charge on it. They are shipping a new brush hopefully it works.",97
515,It's all that you need.,5,"It doesn't have bluetooth and database tie ins, but if all you want is something that brushes well with a 30-second short timer and 2-minute long timer, this fits the bill. It took overnight to charge the first time, but has been working well since. Once you get used to it, a regular toothbrush doesn't cut it. This is my 3rd Oral-B and even though the model name has changed, the brush is essentially the same. It accepts all the Oral-B brush heads that I have.",86
516,Not a fan.,2,"Very loud toothbrush (louder than any other electric TB I’ve tried) and the tooth brush head it comes with (said to be their best) is too large for my mouth and teeth (even their “smaller” option is quite large!), takes too long to remove any plaque build up, and water/toothpaste gets trapped in the crevices of the toothbrush - which starts to smell even after cleaning with alcohol, etc. Would not recommend to anyone with a small mouth/teeth or any sort of oral sensitivity. Will not purchase again.",88
517,Very large brush head and very loud,2,"The brush head (entire unit) is huge - can't brush my teeth without making a huge mess with toothpaste running down my face. Sonicare felt much more natural. The toothbrush is also very loud, as others have mentioned. The blinking light never shuts off, to indicate the battery is fully charged, even if I keep it plugged in and charging regularly.",61
518,It's an electronic toothbrush,5,It brushes teeth and don't like it as much as a normal toothbrush.,13
519,Works great and deep cleaning everyday,5,"my First epectric thoothbrush
Extremely satisfied and recommended to my mother
I used it for 9 days so far
I don't have problem charging still charging and works great
using electric thoothbrush gives deep cleaning of my theeth",38
520,"Good toothbrush, bad charger",3,Great toothbrush but the charging port is flawed. It collects water and gets moldy and gross since it pools down. I've had for a few years and still works great otherwise. Considering a new one because im tired of scrubbing this every few days at the bottom and the charger is permanently discolored and looks bad.,56
521,Vibrates your entire head,1,"I bought this to replace another braun oral b to which i lost the base. I bought what appeared to be the closest replacement. This unit is decidedly ""skinnier"" and I don't know if that's why, but there is so much vibration delivered from the unit, to the brush and then your teeth, that my whole head practically buzzes. Really, really uncomfortable and a deal killer for me. Super uncomfortable compared to last braun which appeared completely comparable in size and features - could care less if my toothbrush was bluetooth! Very unhappy with this product.",96
522,Good product made even better!,5,I've been using Oral-B for over 20 years and each one has been an improvement over the last. This one is no exception. Timer is more intelligent and they upped the cleaning strength. Hands down the absolute best I've ever used! I'd recommend it to anyone.,46
523,Stops charging in 1.5 years,2,Worked OK until it didn't. It just stopped charging one day. I expected better from a $90 toothbrush.,18
524,Did not work,1,"Had done my research on best value for electric toothbrush to replace my older one of another brand. Pick this one.
Charged it all night, did not work in the morning. Waited a bit more but never worked. Very disappointed. Returned it and ordered the same brand I had before",50
525,Works well,3,"I bought this Oral-B Pro 1000 to replace my 10-year old Oral-B predecessor, and it works very well - good power. But I wish it had some rubber grips on the handle because it's hard to manipulate when it gets wet.",41
526,Say goodbye to plaque!,5,"I received this as a Christmas gift and am THRILLED with it. Just the facts: it comes with one ClassAction brush head. The power cord is about 49” long. The power base is about 2.5” long. It doesn’t come with the brush head holder. The Sensitive and Whitening brushing modes don’t come with this model. The timer’s tittering sound is easy to miss at first until you recognize it as something other than part of the background noise. It comes with a rechargeable battery already in place, which is a good thing as I have yet to figure out how to open the battery chamber. The review: I’m scheduled for my next 6 month checkup in January so my teeth could use some TLC. I used the toothbrush with ActiveWOW activated charcoal whitening toothpaste. After using it ONCE my teeth feel like my dental hygienist has cleaned and polished them! The difference is really amazing.",155
527,Worth the money,4,"The product came timely, and I feel the difference brushing my teeth. The only issue is the pamphlet wasn't very instructional about the timer and pressure gauge otherwise I would have given it a 5*. I did research in advance and this toothbrush rated well.",45
528,Better cleaning,5,I bought one for me & decided to give it to my husband who has never used an electric toothbrush. I ordered another for me. I’ve used one for years & get better cleaning results over a standard toothbrush. Everyone should try one for improved teeth cleaning. It doesn’t remove the need to floss but....,55
529,Best toothbrush.,5,"Absolutely love this toothbrush. I’ve always had the cheap electric toothbrushes and never thought there could be such a difference but I was so wrong. This one is amazing, I can just feel it cleaning so much more than any other one I’ve had and it has so much power behind it. It’s super light weight and I love that you can buy different brush heads for it. I highly recommend this to anyone.",74
530,No coupon but still happy,5,one think I have noticed is that you can use coupons at walmart easier vs amazon on things like this but still happy I feel like my kids have less excuses to brush their teeth. This thing is awesome at doing everything your kids should be doing effort wise in brushing. Its so worth it.,55
531,Disappointed - Need to clean brush head into handle every time you use it,2,"Reviews on this product seemed so great I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Long story short, the way the brush heads connect to the handle allows for toothpaste build up and they get disgusting very quickly. Unless you want to wipe down the bottom of the toothbrush head/top of handle every time you use it I would avoid these. I actually threw mine out and all day long prefer the Sonicare I just bought. Much more of a seemless transition btwn brush head and handle and they stay clean. Plus I feel like my teeth are way cleaner with the Sonicare motion vs oral b. Disappointed with this purchase for sure.",111
532,Glad I bought it,5,"My dentist told me to stop using the standard toothbrush and switch to one of these. I'm glad he forced the decision on me. I'm brushing much better and hitting only teeth instead of also getting gums.

The timer feature works wonders, you just move from one part of the mouth to the other once it vibrates.",57
533,a great buy,5,"works great, replaced a several year old same brand power brush that had zero battery life so it had to live on the charger meaning it wouldn't work well after the 1st day of trip unless you brought along the giant charger, this one though has a much smaller charger cradle that would fit in my shaving kit, it also feels more powerful than my old one, & quieter too. it's either on or off, my old one had like 3 settings where you had to hit the powerbutton 3x to get it to turn off, i much prefer the on/off only as i never used those other modes anyway",110
534,Great purchase,5,"Love the product, hands down. Love the pulsing signal that tells me when it’s time to move into the next quadrant. My last electric toothbrush died, so I used a manual version for about a year. Could definitely tell the difference at my dentist visit. This is a pretty basic model but I would highly recommend it. My only complaint is there’s nothing you can do about it start with the cord it takes up a bit of space on your countertop or vanity top. But worth it",88
535,Great product except wobbly standing handle,5,Great product cleans very well especially if you have a small mouth to get around the very back molars. Setting the handle on the stand is wobbly a bit. I would have preferred a more snug fit. Thick cord and comes with a total of 3 brushes. Doesn't need to be charged often. I highly recommend. Great on price point.,60
536,Solid toothbrush for great price,4,"Much cheaper than some of the other toothbrushes. Not sure why people need/want all the bells and whistles. You don't really need them. That said, I'll be hypocritical and state that I really like the timer/alarm which pulses once every 30 seconds. It has made me get the full recommended 2 minutes of brushing in nearly every time. Also, powered toothbrushing is light years better than manual brushing. My teeth are MUCH better off now that I've finally listened to my dentist's nagging.",83
537,Buy this you won't regret it,5,"Perfect travel electric toothbrush at a great price. I didn't want to spend a fortune on a travel brush with case, etc. but I did want an electric similar to what I use at home. This is a name brand at a great price. I bought some toothbrush head covers and it all fits nicely in my dopp kit. I don't take the base even though it's pretty compact since a full charge lasts quite a few days. I recharge it every few weeks and have never felt that it was losing power due to low battery. I would definitely buy this again.",103
538,Amazing my teeth are insanely white after this,5,The deep cleaning from this brush is amazing. I’ve had yellow teeth for awhile even while using mouth wash and a knock off sonicare. Ever since I’ve had this my teeth have been noticeably whiter even my fiancé was impressed and noticed without me saying anything. Best $50 I’ve spent,50
539,My all time favorite!,5,"Awesome toothbrush!

Downside is the charging station replacement is the same darn price as the toothbrush set itself!

One full charge gets you about 7-10 days of brushing.

Does the timer, and fully charges in about an hour.

The blinking light while charging is terribly annoying if you’re in a dark room and have it nearby, though.

Clean smile and no bleeding gums! Couldn’t get as clean with the competitor toothbrush on the market.",74
540,Misleading information,1,"Misleading information.
1. Description on Amazon website is for ""cross action"". Not triaction as in package insert.
2. There is only 1 brush head, which means I'd be having to order brush heads in a week or so.
3. Package insert says to register your brush for $15 instant savings. At the end of registration, all that's offered is $5. Again, misleading info.",63
541,Working out pretty well so far,4,"Working out pretty well so far, first electric toothbrush in quite some time. Head oscillates very quickly and it does provide a bit of 'thrum' in the head that takes some getting used to when you're done. It seems to produce good results when done though, teeth are nice and smooth for the day. Not sure I like the hiccup and pause reminders every 30 seconds. I'd rather just keep on doing my routine.",74
542,I can't believe how much of a difference it makes.,5,"I can't believe how much cleaner my teeth feel after using this. It takes almost no effort and I feel like I just came from seeing the dentist everytime I brush with this. I've heard that some people are not used to an electric toothbrush but if you asked me, its well worth the effort. You can brush normally with it also if you don't want to turn it on at any particular moment.",74
543,Nice not having to replace batteries so often.,5,"I like the speed, always reliable, and feels like deep cleaning.",11
544,Fundamentally terrible: brush heads get moldy or mildewy despite cleaning,1,"The brush heads get moldy or mildewy after a few weeks even if you rinse and dry them after every brush, removing the brush head between brushes.

It has an atrocious design: there's an opening right in the brush head's ""neck"" that just invites mold or mildew to grow.

I put an order of magnitude less effort into cleaning my previous brush, and got no mold or mildew in years with a single brush head.",75
545,"Excellent brushing, but low battery life",3,"I had a Braun toothbrush five tears ago which I replaced with Sonic Care. I do prefer the brush heads on the Braun, but the battery life is terrible on this model. The description says 10 days, but by the fourth day the rpms have dropped to a crawl. I’m single and I brush twice a day for two minutes each time. Maybe, if you only brush once a day it’ll make it a week. Both my old Braun toothbrush and the Sonic Care lasted well over a week when they were new. Typically, I replace my electric brushes, when they only last as long as this model does, and it’s new.",112
546,"solid electric toothbrush, but difficult to justify cost vs older models",3,"likes:
seems to have better battery life than pro 500
the thin sleek black handle design is nice
indicator lights for charging and requiring charge
30 sec timer stutter function to aid in quadrant brushing

dislikes:
pressure sensor for hard brushing doesn't seem to work upon hard brushing test (or is too subtle to notice, but doesn't that just defeat the purpose?)
charging light doesn't indicate when fully charged
twice as expensive as my previous pro 500",77
547,economical and very efficient,5,Thoroughly cleans teeth and gums yet gentle. Love the timer while brushing. The brush heads are not expensive and interchangeable from one style of Oral-B to another which is a money saver. Best toothbrush I've had.,36
548,Makes Me Brush Better,5,This toothbrush has helped me be better about brushing my teeth. I love that it buzzes when 30sec have passed so you know to move on to another section. I can already tell an improvement in my brushing!,38
549,damaged box,1,I am not satisfied with this product because the box was damaged after delivery. I wanted to give it to my sister as a gift but I could do that because of the damaged box. I have no time to but another one.,43
550,Takes a long time to charge.,4,"It took me a few weeks to get used to it, but it's a solid no-frills toothbrush. The only thing I don't like is that it takes a while to charge. I don't like to keep it in the base because I don't want to wear out the battery- and I only charge it when the red battery warning light is illuminated. However, I find that if I charge it before I go to bed, it's not finished charging by morning. It's a nice toothbrush for the money, but it charges so slowly!",93
551,Great for timing your daily teeth brushing,5,"When I used my new Oral-B Black Pro 1000 (didn't read the instructions of course) I thought it was defective due to the random stuttering of the motor while brushing. When I finally read the instructions, I realized the stuttering was, in fact, a good thing, signaling 30-second intervals during the brushing process. This makes timing your two-minute brushing protocol quite easy to manage.

Also, as I continue to use the device and do more research on the different brush heads available it is clear that the brush does a remarkable job cleaning my teeth. Tartar, plaque, and food particles are significantly reduced.

I had used a different electric brush for years and am extremely happy with this purchase.",119
552,Disappointed,3,"I purchased the Oral-B Black Pro 1000 in February ($10 more than what it costs now), 8 months later the black is coming off the toothbrush body. Battery performance is also very poor. The Oral-B Cross Action Power Electric Toothbrush I had to replace after 4 years worked for over 1 week on a full charge - the Pro 1000 has to be charged every other day. I'm very disappointed with this product. Not the quality I expected from Braun.",80
553,Great deep cleaning and leaves teeth feeling shiny,5,My husband ordered this for himself and loved it so I ordered a second one. Works excellent. Cleans teeth excellent. Leaves your teeth feeling like you just left the dentist from a cleaning. Like the timer as it indicates how long you should spend on each section of your mouth.,50
554,Most amazing tooth brush!!,5,"I have to say.. this is by far the best tooth brush I’ve ever owned. I had a quip before and I just felt that it wasn’t doing the job. Then when I bought this tooth brush, everything changed. My mouth is cleaner, and the brush hits hard to reach areas! It’s powerful and does a great job! It’s great on your gums and the timer is so helpful!",69
555,Battery or charger issues,1,"I think it's a great toothbrush, but I purchased 2 of these and they both got fried at almost exactly a year. No water has ever touched the base, but last when I put the toothbrush on the charger last night, it actually sizzled. $40/year for a toothbrush is pretty ridiculous. I reached out to Oral B/Braun to see if they could help. No response in a couple days. I'll try again after about a week. If they don't address the issue, I won't purchase another Oral B or Braun product.",91
556,Worth the money,5,"Just received the toothbrush today. Let it charge for a few hours and then tried it out. The vibration/rotation of the head is strong, which is exactly what I was looking for. I bought a cheap generic electric toothbrush a while ago and that stopped rotating once you pushed it gently on your teeth, so to me this one is a homerun!",62
557,Take that Grush,4,"After using this toothbrush my eyes have been open to the 8th dimension of white teeth world, my teeth and my soul has been cleansed by the 3d whitening technology of these bristles vibrating the demons of my habitual eating sins out of my body and casted into the shadows on my drains. Take thee, sinners, unto thine mouth and wipe away years of grime from the root of your souls.... in other words, its a toothbrush that goes BRRR and its alright.",83
558,"Should be rated a five, but. . .",4,"the recharging base is not stable. Fortunately, I tried the wall mounted charger from my previous Oral-B and it works fine. So, I just put the new charging base in a drawer. Why in the world would they design a wobbly base? Makes no sense to me. BUT, the toothbrush itself works great and is a good replacement for the one that finally died from an aging battery. Recommended.",69
559,Keep looking,1,"This is the worst electric toothbrush that I have ever owned. The battery life is horrible and it often cuts off in the middle of brushing even if it has been charged overnight. It is a complete waste of money, and you’re stuck with it because who returns a toothbrush, especially during a pandemic?",54
560,Fresher breath,5,This baby is great follow the charging instructions and you can not go wrong! Deep cleaning and the brush sensor is nice feature to have on a toothbrush. It let's you know when to apply the correct amount of pressure.,40
561,Very happy with this new toothbrush.,4,"Toothbrush works well, cleans great. My had does seem to get wet and slippery on the handle so I end up holding it really toward the top. Other than that geat product.",32
562,Great cleaning,5,Had to return my first one due to a grinding noise. But the return was simple as can be and the replacement was prompt. I love this thing absolutely love it. Having a small mouth this makes it way easier and less painful than the one that goes side to side which I have tried before. I wouldn't use anything other than this ever again. Have my friends buying them also,71
563,Mold and mildew nightmare,1,It was fine for a few months - action not as good as sonicare nor the 7000 model - but ok with that. Several months later i realised the device has crevices at the head and sides that allow for water seepage in side but does not air out ... i'm someone that always removes the brush.. after a few months the device started smelling bad. I did everything I could to try and clean disinfect but to no avail.. it had to be thrown away.,86
564,Too powerful - caused tooth sensitivity. Want to feel like sneezing while you brush your teeth?,1,"I went to the dentist and he said I was brushing too hard if my teeth were sensitive. That was after I started using this. It's a bummer because it's past the return date. The vibration is way too powerful and makes my nose tingle. Feeling like I have to sneeze every time I brush my teeth really blows.

There's no way for you to test the vibration so the product might be a hit or miss for you as well.",81
565,RATING PRODUCT,3,I did not like this electric toothbrush. It would probably work ok for others. My teeth are not as hard as most people and I felt it was brushing off a bit of the enamel off my teeth so I quit using it. I'm sure most people would like it.,50
566,Great Electric Toothbrush,5,I sought out a great electric toothbrush for my husband. I already have an older Oral B and knew this was a well made item. My husband loves this and especially the floss action of the brush. This is truly a great oral hygiene item with a great price.,49
567,Prefer sonicare,1,"Hated this thing. Used it for over a year, which was very stupid of me -- a year too long. I don't think this thing cleaned my teeth effectively whatsoever -- I always had to floss and would still get plaque/gunk on the floss. I had sonicare for several years before this and finally went back and am so much happier.",61
568,"Value engineering at is best - loud, vibrates too much, and cheap black plastic - do not buy",1,"Value engineering at is best - loud, vibrates too much, and black plastic finish is the cheapest plastic I have seen in decades.

I wanted to replace an older Oral-B. In comparison this model is way louder, vibrates almost uncomfortably. This looks like a $9 tootbrush",46
569,Great brush,5,"One of the best out there. Highly comparable to the Sonicare Series 2. Compared to its higher-end siblings like the 3000 or 7000, the 1000 pro lacks fancier features like different speed modes, pressure sensor, and Bluetooth connectivity. However, if you don't have sensitive gum, you probably do not need pressure sensor, and if you do not obsess about logging your brushing performance in an app, then you can do without Bluetooth connectivity as well. For basic effective cleaning, this one does the job. It gives 20,000 rotations per minute. Two minutes of brushing with this leaves you with a fresh feeling mouth. Definitely a good investment. One thing to take care of, if you want to use it outside the US, then you might want to consider the Sonicare since that is compatible with dual voltage (110/220 volts). The Oral B however, only supports 110 volts.",147
570,Strong toothbrush,5,Wanted a toothbrush to help remove plaque/only main issue I had. Works super well at removing plaque from teeth/gum and I do feel it going deep down into my teeth to clean them,33
571,Quit working after 8 months,1,This toothbrush worked great for 8 months then the motor slowed way down and it struggles to spin at all. No amount of charging helps. I'm very disappointed that I have to look into buying another one. They're so expensive and should last more than 8 months.,47
572,Best brush I've ever used,5,The title says it all for this one. This is easily the best toothbrush Ive ever use. My teeth have never felt so clean and I feel like they have never been whiter. The timer is a nice feature as well,41
573,"Works well, but it's loud",4,"My dentist told me I was brushing too hard and recommended an electric toothbrush. I shopped around and found that most were really expensive, so i was happy to find this one at such an affordable price and had so many positive reviews. I'm pretty happy with it---my teeth felt super clean after the first use.

Minus one star because its LOUD. My husband even asked ""what the H--- is that sound? what are you doing in there?"" Note, he had to shout this, because I couldn't hear him over the noise that this toothbrush makes.",96
574,"Too Weak, but good as a starter",3,"I had used a cheapo electric toothbrush before this one. When I had switched to this one, it was a nice upgrade. Unfortunately, its too weak and the timer is too hard to notice. I can't really complain for the price, but the brush heads are pretty expensive and hard to find. I bought a bunch from a big warehouse store, and when they run out I'll be looking for an upgrade.",72
575,Works really well!,5,"I was really impressed! I had never had an electric toothbrush before but my roommate recommended it. I bought a cheap $10 electric toothbrush about two months ago and it died every week and was rough on my gums even though it was supposed to be for sensitive gums. I decided to get this rechargeable one since it had such good reviews. Wow, what a difference! My mouth feels so much cleaner and it does not bother my guns at all. I swear my teeth already look whiter! I wish I would have taken a before and after picture. The only thing is I miss is my tongue scrubber on the back of the toothbrush head. This one doesn't have one, but the brush works pretty well on the tongue. I would defiantly recommend this toothbrush!",136
576,Worth ever penny,5,"I cannot comment on the bluetooth connectivity or app features because I have yet to use it but as far as functionality of the brush itself it is amazing. I have never had my teeth this healthy before. I remember my first time using it, I ran my tongue across my teeth after and from that point forward I was sold. Its worth every penny..",65
577,Great product and price was right!,5,"As I said in my last review I have had this product are bought this product for years now and it works great.
I haven't found anything wrong with it it's more powerful because it's newer.
My other one lasted several years and hope this one does the same!",49
578,This product has delivered!,4,I bought this for my husband for he has been struggling with plaque and tartar buildup and this product has delivered! He likes how the head spins unlike other competitors; his teeth feel clean like he just went to the dentist. The drawback is it takes a long time to fully charge.,52
579,If the battery lasts more than a year it’ll be a miracle,4,Last two the battery didn’t last more than a year I would hope this one would,16
580,Doesn’t last 3 months,1,Unfortunately the product died right before 90 days of buying it. One day it worked. The next day it wouldn’t charge or turn on. Also the timer never worked and I purchased 2 items and neither timer worked. I called customer service and they transferred me to “Lime” in IT to troubleshoot my toothbrush. His advice was to buy a new lithium battery because I missed my window to return the product. Basically did not help me at all. Very disappointing.,81
581,Switching from manual to electric,5,"I’ve been using this toothbrush for a few weeks now and have noticed significant decrease in my gums bleeding. Prior to buying this, I had a periodontal deep cleaning and was told by my dentist to switch from a manual to an electric toothbrush and it’s the best decision I’ve made. It kind of hurts at first because it’s so much stronger than a manual, but the clean feeling it gives my mouth is incredible. And it only takes a few brushings to get used to the extra pressure. I’m anticipating my next dentist appointment in a few months to see how well it really works, but so far, I’m really satisfied.",112
582,Makes brushing your teeth fun!,5,"There is nothing I dislike. I love brushing my teeth now. My dentist recommended this as I get plaque build up real easy, especially on my back teeth. It’s so easy to use and clean.",35
583,Best I’ve ever had!,5,"Excellent toothbrush! I’ve had several electric toothbrushes and this one is by far the best. It is very powerful, deep cleans and makes my teeth feel smooth, my mouth 10x fresher and my teeth are whiter! Buy this toothbrush folks! You won’t regret it!",44
584,Oral B - the go to for Electric Toothbrushes.,5,"I've used other brands but OralB seems to do the best job and last the longest. This one replaces my previous OralB. I can always count on a good price and a good product. Just wish I wouldn't have waited so long to replace the old one, I didn't realize how slowwwww the old one was operating.",57
585,Effective and lightweight,5,"My mom (93) needed a toothbrush to effectively clean her teeth. This is it! It's a slim fit in her hand, lightweight, easy to manipulate, and powerful rotary cleaning without feeling like a drill going off in her mouth. Very nice! Wish I'd bought it for her awhile back!",49
586,Not as powerful as the one I have,3,"I have an Oral-B Pro 1000 tooth brush and wanted to buy one for my dad. The one I got did not have the phrase ""powered by Braun"" anywhere on the box, so I was a bit skeptical. I charged it full and used my brush head to compare the two and while the new one was working, it was not as powerful as the one I have. I am returning it.",72
587,Works great,5,This was a replacement Oral B toothbrush for one that finally gave out after twelve years of use. This toothbrush is high powered and does a nice cleaning job.,29
588,Great buy,4,My dentist recommend this to keep my teeth healthy between cleaning. I love how the brushes brush every part of my tooth with ease. I like the timing for each side and my teeth has been cleaner. I am so glad I bought this!,44
589,Attractive and Effective,5,"This brush is exactly what I was looking for! It is a wonderfully functional toothbrush that doesn't look like an eyesore while sitting on the charger on the counter. Beyond its attractive looks, this brush provides a superior clean. My teeth and mouth feel clean for a very long time after brushing. Furthermore, and I can't believe I'm writing this, but I actually want to take this brush to work with me so I can brush after lunch; as this feels so nice to use! It's too bad that the restrooms are not very private and I may get a few odd looks if I am using a professional toothbrush in the restroom. I would highly recommend this brush!",119
590,Best Toothbrush I've Ever Had,5,"This is definitely the best toothbrush i've ever had. One of my favorite features is the charger. The charger is kind of like a holder for the toothbrush and there really isn't much contact. The toothbrush kind of just sits on top of the charger. I also love the fact that there is a timer on it. For every 30 seconds it is working, it will vibrate once and when it hits 2 minute it vibrates three times. Not to mention that it is also very comfortable. It isn't very thick like most electric toothbrushes, the heads are easily replaceable, and it is also completely waterproof. Very pleased overall with this product.",112
591,Great cleaning action and long battery life.,5,"I really feel like the cleaning action around the gum line, which is most important to me, is the big plus for this appliance. The timer is a nice extra, and the battery lasts a good amount of time for several cleanings.",42
592,ok electric toothbrush,3,"I had another electric toothbrush that I loved, but the battery died so I started looking for a replacement. We had gotten my previous electric toothbrush as a set, but the other one stilled worked so I didn't want to spend the money on another set. I saw this one had pretty good reviews and wasn't terribly expensive so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately I don't love it. Its pretty loud and the charge doesn't last as long as my old one.",85
593,Great product,5,"Great toothbrush, great replacement for my previous toothbrush. Just bought the basic one because didn't need all of the expensive bells and whistles. No idea why I'm being asked to review the Bluetooth capability, this one doesn't have Bluetooth.",39
594,Great entry level electric toothbrush,5,Great electric toothbrush. No extra feature that make a toothbrush expensive. It does have a timer function which helps ensure you clean each quadrant of your mouth,27
595,Loud,2,"So loud! My husband has to shout over the noise to talk to me while I'm brushing my teeth. It's very irritating. Unfortunately, it also works really well so if you're ok with the noise level you'll probably love it.",40
596,Very happy!!,5,"I was skeptical about buying this toothbrush because some bad reviews. However, once I started using it I loved it. Makes my mouth and teeth feel very clean. The brush head that it comes with is perfect size and makes brushing easier since it is circular. The timer is very helpful. You brush the four quadrants of the mouth for 30 seconds which ends up being 2 minutes which is the preferred toothbrushing time. Once thing is I do have to add more tooth paste so I split up the 30 seconds. I do my bottom sides for 30 seconds, add more tooth paste, and then do the top sides for 30 seconds.",113
597,Awesome brush,5,"I love this brush. Nice size in my hand, not as fat as older models. It looks nice. Works great. My complaint is that the timer and pressure alerts feel the same do it just feels like it buzzes a lot in my mouth and I don't know why. But whatever. I love it was more than a standard brush, and more than my husband's sonicare.",66
598,Excelentes !!,5,"Son de gran calidad, los recomiendo. Es el segundo que tengo, el anterior era uno de los primeros que salieron me parece que los serie 500, me duraron mucho hasta que cumplieron su vida útil.
Muy contento con estos y el color es genial. Compre 3 uno para cada miembro de la familia.
Recomendado 100%",55
599,Great bang for your buck!,5,"This is a great toothbrush for the price. No frills and right to the point. It operates very easily and has a nice simple grip. It gets the job done without all the nonsense of these newer electric brushes (bluetooth connectivity, etc). The heads are replaceable and come off easy but stay on while brushing. The toothbrush leaves you feeling extra smooth like you just got done at the dentist. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to go to an electric brush and doesn't want to spend over $50.",92
600,Disappointing quality,3,This is my third Oral B electric toothbrush. This one is definitely inferior to my first two. Sometimes the brush head loosens and rattles from the vibration. It also doesn't have indicator lights to show when the battery is getting low.,41
601,Excellent!,5,"The best toothbrush I have ever owned, including previous power toothbrushes. My teeth and breath seem cleaner and fresher since using. It works great, is easy to clean, and the battery life is very good. The charger stand is a nice bonus too.",43
602,Almost easy to use affordable Fitness Tracker,4,"I feel this is a pretty decent 'dupe' for the national brand fitness tracker that is out there.

I've had this for about 3 weeks and overall pretty happy with it with what I originally wanted it for. Setting up, it took a few tries to figure out how to pair it to my Bluetooth. The trick is the the 'face' has to be on in order to pair. So just tap it until the clock face comes on and that should be able to pair the device.

One thing that I can't figure out is how to track my fitness. I think it's accurate as a pedometer (a basic pedometer app on that I have on my phone and the pedometer on the fitness tracker are pretty similar).

However, the main reason why I got this band was to monitor my fitness i.e, how many calories I burn, maximum heart rate, fat burn range) while I'm working out. There is no way my heart rate is only at 88 and burn 50 calories after a 30 minute HIIT sweat sesh. No way, no how.

Overall, decent for the price. I would be wowed if I can get the 'sport' mode to work to get what I want from this device.

The bracelet itself if light weight, comfortable to wear and the pink has some peach undertone to it, so it is rather cute.",234
603,Timing devise,3,"It works well enough, but I don't like the timing device. Other brushes I have used count out 4 30 second intervals and then stop. This brush does not. It continues going and that seems to count against you next time you use the brush. Haven't gotten around to checking with Braun yet to see if I can adjust it. Probably, I'll continue using it until I feel I've gotten my money's worth out of it and then order a Sonic Care.",82
604,Loud like a chain saw,3,I guess this brushes my teeth well or whatever. I just can’t get past how loud it is. It makes me think that it’s defective. my baby wakes up when I use it it’s so loud.,36
605,Best toothbrush!,5,"I got one for everyone in my family, the battery life is great and the charging stations double as amazing toothbrush stands. The battery life is pretty good too! I’ve had them over a year and they’re all still running great. You definitely don’t need the more expensive models, this will give you everything you need",56
606,Good.,4,"I'm giving this 4 stars since I have had no serious issues with it yet, but can't give it a 5 because the bristles are just really hard and it doesn't make brushing my teeth as enjoyable as it can be... This is only my 2nd electric toothbrush (only replaced my old one because my old one created too much of a mess) and I think i might just need to use it awhile to get used to it. But my initial reaction is: this will work.",87
607,Great brush! Annoying timer!,5,"If you've never used an electric brush before you'll definitely feel a difference the first time you use it, almost as if you would be by the dentist. If you brush for longer than 2 minutes there's an annoying timer function which stops and starts and stops and starts and makes a mess and can't be disabled.",57
608,Best toothbrush ive had,5,This thing is cool and with power and so many heads thT can connect to it the section by section timer it brushes to is super nice and by far my favorite toothbrush worth the money and so affordable!,39
609,It’s a good toothbrush,5,"This model doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the higher end ones, but it accomplishes its one goal just fine: it cleans your teeth. I do like the timer feature, which gives you little vibrations so you know when to move to another section of your mouth.",49
610,I like it better than a sonicare But pools at base,5,The only thing I don’t like about this toothbrush is that it really leaves a pole of toothpaste the bottom when you put it back on the thing even though you’ve rinsed it off well and it have to be cleaned frequently much more frequently than the sonicare but I like the product better than sonicare in that I feel like it cleans your teeth better so overall I’m very happy,71
611,Looks nice and works fine.,4,"This works fine, but I don't see a lot of advantages over the much cheaper base model (that just lasted me 7 years!). The quadrant timer is hard to get used to and not really necessary to me. The old 2 minute timer was fine. It doesn't get food between your teeth as well as the floss head, but you can buy the floss heads and put them on it. It says it also has sonic cleaning. I can't tell the difference, but maybe I will over time.",88
612,Great little toothbrush,5,"I really like this toothbrush, my first one lasted 5.5 years without issue so i figured id replace with the same model. Doesn't look like much has changed. I don't need a lot of features, its a toothbrush... This one works, and for $30 you can't go wrong. Love it.",50
613,weak battery,3,"Love everything about it except that the weak battery won't hold a charge for more than a week, and takes 2 days to charge.
Also, who the hell cares about bluetooth on their dang toothbrush??? What's next ""smart"" toilet paper???",40
614,works well,5,Teeth really feel clean after using.. It may be a bit loud - but so what? the timer is sort of helpful in equalizing time spent on different quadrants. (and keeping y ou brushing) can't comment on battery life since I keep it in charger,45
615,Very happy with this toothbrush!,5,"Had been using a standard toothbrush but this one was recommended by my dentist so I decided to give it a try - it makes all the difference in the world. Your teeth feel much cleaner after brushing with this. It pulses every 30 seconds as it recommends brushing your teeth a quarter at a time for 30 seconds. Also, if you apply too much pressure, it stalls until you get back to the right pressure. Getting one for both my wife and daughter.",84
616,Buy Sonicare. It’s 10x better.,1,It’s hard to explain the mechanism but it’s just poor. Philips sonicare is what I was replacing and I fully regret it. The vibration and “sonic” mechanism of the philips is far far superior. Returning this immediately.,37
617,No longer a caveman,5,My teeth have never felt cleaner! I don’t know why I didn’t get this years ago. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to caveman toothbrushes. My teeth feel so smooth and soft and they honestly look whiter to me. Would absolutely recommend! The timer works great too. Only con is it is a little loud.,56
618,Best toothbrush I've owned.,5,"I love this toothbrush! I've always thought that an electric toothbrush was almost lazy and that I could do a better job manually, I was wrong! My teeth feel like I just left the dentist chair after a cleaning. I've also felt a difference in how my gums feel. Before I would brush my teeth very aggressively because it felt like I was cleaning them better, all this did was create more sensitivity. I accompanied this less invasive toothbrush with Colgate sensitive toothpaste and have felt a difference in my sensitivity to hot and cold after just 2 days. I will never go back to a manual again!",108
619,Strong spin plus long-reach,5,"Strong spin, unlike the other films electronic toothbrushes that doesn't spin when you apply pressure this one does. Another plus is its long reach, perfect to get all my teeth at the back.",33
620,Love it,5,I thought the small brush would be annoying but I love it . Gets into the hard to reach places and you can feel the difference and see the difference . 100% recommend,33
621,Messy,2,"I am a fan of the Oral B electric toothbrush family, but this particular brush has been unpleasant throughout the 6 months that I have used it. It dribbles toothpaste and saliva under the brush head and down the handle??? I've tried changing the brush head, several times with no improvement. Since I've never experienced this issue in all the years I have used Oral B, I will try one more, but go cautiously with this model, it may be messy . . .",84
622,Best toothbrush,5,"I love my toothbrush!! I did have to change the head out because the one it came with was too hard... I got a one for sensitive gums, which was great. Great buy!",33
623,"Simple operation, simple on and off. Works well without unnecessary programming. Good price.",5,I wanted something simple . I don’t need timers or fancy settings. It’s a little loud but I don’t need a concert. Does the job and works the gums and teeth well.,32
624,Nice toothbrush,5,This was a fantastic buy and I am happy with my purchase. My teeth are singing songs of joy from being so clean.....when I brush with this toothbrush my lips and teeth smile .,34
625,Poor product. Don't waste your money.,1,"When I first got this toothbrush, I was surprised at how short the time was between it needing charged. It also takes a full 2 days to charge. I should have returned it then. Now, when it is too late to return it, it only holds a charge for a couple of days. This is so frustrating. This is a waste of money. I purchased this midway December 2020. Today is April 1 2021 and I will be in search of another toothbrush. Do not buy this product.",88
626,Can't believe I've waited so long to buy an electric toothbrush!,5,"I love this thing. After years of my dentist recommending that I switch to an electric toothbrush, I finally pulled the trigger. And it is amazing! My partner was so jealous of my insanely clean teeth that he ordered himself one too! This model doesn't have many bells and whistles, which is why I like it. The brush head cleans effectively, and it does vibrate one a minute for the first two minutes to help you know how long to brush and when to switch from your top/bottom teeth.",89
627,The Best Electric Toothbrush,5,I actually look forward to brushing my teeth! This toothbrush does all the work. I've recently had extensive dental work done & wanted something to maintain my beautiful teeth. It does such a thorough job & I couldn't be more pleased.,41
628,Defective,1,"Brand new out of the box the toothbrush would not charge. The charging light simply never came on and the battery was dead. Who knows if it was the charger or the toothbrush that was defective. Now that I'm seeing other reviews, it seems clear that Oral-B will sell you a really low quality product, if not completely defective. Stay away.",61
629,Stopped working,3,"I’ve had this for 8 months. It makes noise but doesn’t work anymore. I had bought a regular battery toothbrush in 2019 and that still works.
So obviously I won’t give this 5 stars.",34
630,Junk,1,"As soon as I opened the box, this seemed of poor quality. I followed instructions to the letter. I let it charge 24 hrs until the green light stopped blinking. Read the instructions very carefully. Placed the washer on the toothbrush head and placed in on the handle. Hit the power button and just a slight buzz,,,,??? Hmm, tried again and again,,, hit the power button and nothing but a slight buzz. Returned it,, buy at your own risk.",79
631,Doesn't last very long,1,How long are these supposed to work for? I bought this after my last oral b electric toothbrush died after 8 years of use. I am writing this review because this new oral b toothbrush I bought died and it hasn't even been a year yet.,46
632,Dental hygienist approved,5,As a dental hygienist oral B is my favorite brush. I use it personally and can tell if I switch brushes. I love the timer and the pressure sensor to restrict over brushing. I recommend this product to all of my patients and use it personally.,46
633,Good,5,"Its a great toothbrush, it does as expected and multiple eating modes. I had no problem with it. I ended up returning it because I found a better deal elsewhere.",30
634,I love this toothbrush,5,The best electric toothbrush ever. My only complaint is I wish it had some kind of plastic cover but my mouth feels great after every brushing.,26
635,Game changer,5,"I have had this toothbrush for over a year, and it blows my mind all the negative reviews on here. I have never once had a problem with this toothbrush, and the timer system on this is a game changer! Perfect toothbrush as far as I'm concerned.",47
636,Don’t buy this product,1,The product was defective and I contacted Amazon and no action has been taken to rectify my complaints about the product. I’ve been given the round around. I would give this product zero stars if I could. I’m also disappointed with Amazon’s customer service. I called them and they have not fixed the issue that I have with the product. I’ve been a loyal amazon customer for years and this is the first product that I’ve complained about so one would think that they would take my complaints seriously.,89
637,Better than expectations.,5,My previous electric toothbrush by another brand quit working and so I looked to try another brand as a replacement. I was pleasantly surprised as to how much of better cleaning job and ease of use this toothbrush provides.,39
638,Sounds like Con Edison jackhammering,1,"Very loud ,rough and harsh. Had to look out window to see if Con Edison was tearing up the street.
Have to charge often. In my opinion this is a terrible toothbrush .",33
639,Great product,5,"I don’t brush without it now, just kidding I do, but it’s rare you can’t take it somewhere. Very portable, long-lasting charge, easy to replace heads and pretty cheap. It is pretty loud, I guess, but not to the point it should disturb anyone outside of the room (presumably bathroom) you are using it in.

Easy on gums, easy to reach mouth. You can tell it does more in 30 seconds than 5 minutes of regular brushing would.",78
640,I'm not happy that after I'm done using it and I put ...,3,"I'm giving this 3 stars. The brush itself works well. I'm not happy that after I'm done using it and I put it on the charging stand, it leaks. When I go back and use my brush later in the day, there's dried toothpaste all down the side of it. I have no idea why. I rinse the head of the toothbrush when I'm finished with it. I have no idea where it's dripping from but I find myself constantly cleaning the part that you hold with your hand. Overtime I'm sure this is going to get cruddy and worn down.",101
641,Best Product,5,"I had an Oral B electric toothbrush before, it just died 3 months ago after 5 years. I decided to give the Sonicare brand a try - huge mistake ! I get my teeth cleaned every 3 months and they asked me what I was doing differently, the only thing was that I changed 'tools'. I immediately came home and purchased another Oral B product!
Don't be fooled - this really does the job!",74
642,Great Toothbursh,5,"I love this toothbrush. I have tried several other's and have found this one to be the best for me. The round brush head does a great job of cleaning my teeth and keeping my gums healthier. A great feature is the auto timer, making sure you brush for a full 2 minutes, the brush vibrates every 30 seconds to tell the user it's time to change quadrants in the mouth, ensuring you give adequate brushing to all your teeth.",80
643,Excellent tooth brush!,5,My teeth are sensitive and this does the job. It’s hard to find a great priced product that works. My teeth are do much cleaner and whiter:),27
644,Doesnt get in the cracks,4,Be aware that it really doesn't clean the cracks and crevices of your teeth. After only 3 weeks of use I have a noticable color difference in my teeth where this doesn't get to. Otherwise its absolutely amazing. But it needs to clean all of the teeth.,47
645,It's like going to the dentist and getting your 6-month polishing EVERYDAY!,5,"I am 45 and have never used an electric toothbrush in my life. I thought they were lazy and I didn't need that electronic felgercarb plus the idea of having a big noisy vibrator in my mouth was unappealing. Recently I went to the dentist for my regular 6-month cleaning and was told I had the beginnings of periodontitis. Red flags were raised immediately. I had been very diligent about brushing twice a day so it was a complete shock. I knew something needed to change and not just my brushing techniques.

My wife recommended I try her Oral B electric toothbrush. I thought ""Why not?"" I tried it and immediately loved it! It does a much more effective job of cleaning the teeth and getting in between the teeth and gumline than just brushing thoroughly by hand plus it really polishes the teeth to keep them shiny and white and removes plaque far more effectively. After brushing it feels like I just went to the dentist for my 6 month cleaning only without the gum soreness and puffy gums afterward. After 2 days of use I can already tell that my oral health is improving. My gums feel healthier, no more bleeding and my teeth feel smooth and clean. I am now a firm believer in the electric toothbrush.",220
646,Good cleaning job,5,"I just received this toothbrush today, so I only used it once, but I believe it cleans well. Of course I devote the time to go thoroughly over each tooth. It is also easy to handle. A few years back I bought an electric toothbrush which was way to large and uncomfortable to use. This one is thinner and fits properly in my mouth. No discomfort.",66
647,Great bang for your buck,5,Honestly when it comes to an electric toothbrush all you need is replaceable heads and a timer function. Anything else adds unneeded cost and complexity. This is a great tooth brush. Second one I bought only due to losing the first on a trip.,44
648,Battery doesn't jive.,4,"I was checking the specs on this toothbrush and it says it uses a Lithium- Polymer battery. But then it says on the bottom of the handle, Ni-Mh. Witch one is it ?",33
649,defective :(,1,I bought this on Amazon to replace the one I had for a year that just stopped working for no reason. The red flashing light kept blinking on the old one but I didn't have return slip so I threw it out. This one would not charge after 40 hours. Amazon doesnt have anymore. Can be purchased from 'third party' for $20. more. When Amazon is good it's very very good. When it's bad it's very bad.,77
650,It only lasted 3 months! (unable to replace battery),1,"The battery died, and it can not be replaced with a AA or AAA rechargeable battery (unless you make some modifications), you need to desolder the electronic circuit, and disassembly the entire mechanism in order to get into the battery, then buy the same battery type on line, wait to get it and replace it, and assembly everything again, hoping you didn't damage anything in the process.. what a waste of time and money",74
651,Dental grade cleaning. Love this product,5,Product is amazing. Love the timer and how it shuts off if you press too hard. Feel my teeth getting the cleaning they need,24
652,Great for toddlers,5,"I initially bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer, and she enjoyed it. This review is about the second one I ordered, however.

I have a three year old that has been a pain to brush his teeth since we started. He gags very easily, and even smaller child’s toothbrushes would gag him. My wife suggested trying my daughter’s brush, and it was so great. He now loves getting his teeth brushed, and even asks to go longer. One of the best purchases I have made.",88
653,Much more powerful than earlier generations,5,"I purchased this Oral B electric toothbrush to replace an older model that was having problems holding its charge. I was pleasantly surprised at how much faster this handle rotates the brush heads, and does a much more thorough job. Unlike the older generation that paused every 2 minutes to let you know how long you've been brushing, this one pauses every 30 seconds, which I also like. Uses the same brush heads.",73
654,Good Intro to an Electronic Toothbrush!,5,"After 1 week of use, I absolutely love this product.
I am not sure if it intentionally does the 30second buzz thing because it didn't feel significant enough (like my Clarisonic) to realize if it was buzzing or if it was the toothbrush. I think that's what it is doing in an attempt to tell you to focus on a new area.
My teeth feel better than ever, like when you leave the dentist after the dentist torture :)
I will say, it feels much harder on my teeth then my soft/medium toothbrush - maybe my teeth are/were too sensitive?
For the price, I'd definitely recommend this!",107
655,Replaced my 10 year old OralB,5,Great product. Works better than my old OralB. The different speeds and pressure sensor are a great upgrade. Cleans my teeth even better now.,24
656,Dentist Clean In Minutes,5,"The toothbrush works great! It cleans the surface area of each tooth well. The motorized action achieves a noticeable clean in half the time of a traditional brush. The brush holds a charge got many days. The charging dock is small, sleek, and modern. Replacement brushes are easy to locate, name brand and generic.",54
657,"This is my second electric toothbrush same company different model, really like this one.",5,I am replacing my electric toothbrush after years and this one is great the smaller toothbrush head reaches well itno those hard to get to places. It's quieter and more powerful than my last one. I have nothing but good things to say about it.,45
658,Works great and is affordable!,5,"I just got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it after one use! He says it cleans the hard to reach areas so easily and he wants me to get one now too. He thinks it’s cool it lets him know when every 30 seconds has passed and says it actually cleans where other electric toothbrushes just vibrate. I love that it’s so affordable, same with the different brushes you can buy.",74
659,jeff@debkarasik.com,5,"This is a distinct improvement compared to my 3 year old Vitality model. Some of the features I like are: (1).The embedded timer that pulses at 30 second intervals letting me know it is time to switch quadrants. Formerly, I had to keep an eye on the second hand of my wristwatch while brushing. (2). The brushing action feels better and seems more effective (dental hygienist will let me know for sure); (3). According to the Product Description, the battery has a larger capacity and should last longer without recharging. and (4) It's nice to have a charging indicator on the unit.",102
660,Why didn’t I buy this sooner?,5,"I like that this product really works and the price point is just right. Great investment. Fully charged in no time, easy to use and my teeth look AND FEEL like I just came from a cleaning. 10 out of 10, highly recommend",43
661,Stopped working after 3 weeks,1,"Purchased late December and it’s mid January and it won’t recharge and doesn’t work. Tried changing the outlet, but nothing. When it works it’s a great toothbrush, but don’t trust an online seller.",33
662,Feels like you just got out of the dentist...,4,"Coming from someone who used Sonicare for a while, the first time I used this felt amazing. It was like I just got out of the dentist office. After while that feeling subsides as you get used to how it works, but it still works really well.

All in all, the battery life on these is a little less than the Sonicare Elite's that I had (though to be fair, that was a higher end product than this), but I can easily go 1.5-2 weeks on a single charge on these bad boys, but wish it could go a little longer.

We have 3, one for me, wife, daughter.",109
663,Happy Customer,5,Amazing electric toothbrush and I can tell a big difference in my teeth and gums in just a few days!! My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and found this on Amazon for a great price and wow I’m completely satisfied!,40
664,Great for the right price,5,"I would never pay the list price of $69, $29 then yea no problem. In the end all it really does is vibrate. Does not spin the end or anything like that. Don't get me wrong it works great its just a simple device. I am not seeing anything that the more expensives ones would do any better except the water ones. Well built and battery lasts.",67
665,This is so loud it scares my dog.,3,This toothbrush is so loud it scares my dog. I would not recommend using it if someone is sleeping. It also has some hesitation while using and not completely smooth. it does seem to do the job however.,38
666,Good tooth brush,5,"I just got this tooth brush, it works very good, NO LOUD AT ALL, AIN'T GOT NO BAD SMELL!!!! Really powerful!!!! First charge for 24 hours, I will update this review",31
667,Toothbrush,4,"My third one, only complaint I have is it stops every so often and bounces off and on
I know it is supposed to but I wish it would not",30
668,It Cleans Your Teeth,4,"Does a nice job cleaning your teeth. The brush head is a little big. Not as noisy as some of the comments claim. Overall, it does a good job.",29
669,Compact for Travel,5,I bought this brush for travel and it fits that role with small size and long charge duration. It would be nice if there were black sensitive brush heads to match. I strongly recommend.,34
670,Great Cleaning,5,"I feel like I just left the dentist's office each time I brush my teeth. Took a little while to get used to the intense brushing, but it feels so good.",31
671,Good Value,4,"This brush is very well made and operates fine. I also own a Fairwell P11 and I alternate useage using both once each day. If I had to choose I'd keep the Fairywell as it is the best brush I have ever owned as far as overall cleaning. The rotating head of the Oral B 1000 does an excellent job at the gumline, but the battery recharge requirements are average at best. Neither toothbrush replaces the need to floss however.",80
672,Good quality clean. Nice,5,Still have it look brand new since 2018 function good holds charge more than a week still. Dropped it many times still has only one dent bare noticeable . Clean nice i dont even flush anymore. I used the original head a lot longer than it was supposed to but i still got clean teeth . I ❤️ This 🦷 brush worth the money. I ordered a new one again and will buy more,74
673,Toothbrush or sander?,2,"It is like brushing your teeth with a sander. I had a battery operated Quip brush before which was great, so when it died I figured this would be good quality. I returned it after a day and bought one half the price. Very loud and rough on your teeth.",50
674,Its loud but works,3,"This isn't the best electric toothbrush I've had before but it functions. Its definitely loud like the other reviews have stated. I also find the brush to be a little harder than I'm used to. I haven't tried to find replacement brushes, I hope that won't be a pain.",49
675,Like the Braun best,5,Husband bought this for himself. I personally like the Braun brand better than the Sonic. I like the round head and I think it cleans better. I don't like the Sonic with the removable head which traps old yucky water and breeds trapped bacteria and odor. Braun gets up next to the gums well.,54
676,Nothing special. At all. By a hand held brush instead,2,Nothing special. Cleans teeth well. Where do you put brush heads? Where do you put charge. Oral b on the cheap even the genius x missing a simple screw in holder for charger brush heads and TB. For this money a Chinese made plastic thing to organize brush system woukd really break u? God,54
677,Move on. Not a good choice,1,"Brush way too stiff. My gum was sensitive and hurts for a week after. Had to buy a softer brush. Honestly though huge disappointment with everything. Bad brush, battery lasts for less than a week on full charge and the timer is basically useless. Should get a philips sonicare instead.",50
678,Oral B,5,My first electric toothbrush......teeth and mouth feels really clean. Glad I took my dentist suggestion. I don't have the timer or bluetooth on mine.,24
679,Feels like you just went to the dentist every time you brush,5,"This is a fantastic electronic toothbrush that makes it feel like you went to the dentist each time you're done (minus getting yelled at by your dentist for not flossing). The toothbrush is powerful and can last for over an entire week without having to charge it again (brushing 2x/day at 2 minutes each time). However, I keep mine on the charging stand which automatically stops charging once the battery in the brush is full.

When used, the toothbrush pulsates briefly every 30 seconds to tell you to switch ""zones"" in your mouth. And at 2 minutes, the toothbrush pulsates 4 times to let you know that your brushing is done! It sounds silly, but brushing is slightly more fun now, and feels less like a chore than it used to with a standard toothbrush. Plus, your mouth feels clean and fresh every time you use it. Highly recommended, especially for the price point.",154
680,Best on the market!,5,This is my second oral b. The first one I bought was 2006. That speaks volumes for this brand. I will never buy any other brand! And my last visit to dentist they were surprised I had very little plaque,40
681,Don't know why you'd buy the fancier version!,5,"I'm not really sure I get the difference between this and the ""fancy"" models except maybe the bluetooth. My brother in law has the really nice one and I used it, bought this one, and they seem the same to me except I saved $100. Works great, battery has lasted over a week, attachment snaps in great, the charger is only an inch wide, very low profile.",67
682,Favorite Favorite Favorite,5,I love oral b electric toothbrushes. I can tell my teeth are getting clean. I chose it for it's reputation. I use it because it works,26
683,Just ok not great,3,"I read the reviews and seemed great. Battery doesn't last long.
I don't feel as if it cleans my teeth as good as it says it will.
Takes soooo much longer to brush and get the teeth clean.
Would NOT recommend for children, as they would have to really work to make sure their teeth are clean and what child do you know that would do that?!",67
684,Oral B,4,Can not figure out the timer function. Storage is not convenient unless you leave it plugged in which I did not know when making the purchase.,26
685,Super clean! No joke. Better than other style elec toot,5,"Ok im a regular guy. This works amazingly well. Like just left the dentist clean. Its no joke. The timer is just ok. Not annoying but not sure if its really needed either. I got enough people telling me what to do, i dont need my toothbrush telling what zone and how long. Lol. But really a good product better than the other style electric toothbrushes.",66
686,Better brushing,5,My hygienist suggested that I try using an electric toothbrush to maybe help deal with plaque buildup between cleanings. Since I'm not a big fan of the ultrasonic scaler she uses everytime I visit I figure I should take her advice. At first I didn't like this brush but now I'm a huge fan of it. I do believe that my last visit was better because I quit drinking soda and mostly drink water and coffee. From there I started using this brush and flossing twice a day. But yeah this brush to me is definitely worth the money.,99
687,and we're both very happy with it,5,"My teeth have never felt so clean! I bought multiple heads for this toothbrush so my husband and I could share it, and we're both very happy with it. The vibration action is very strong and takes a couple brushes to get used to, but it's extremely effective. I'm not sure how long the charge lasts since we typically always leave it sitting on the charging by the bathroom sink, but we did take it on a week's vacation with us (without the charger) and it lasted the entire time. Of all the electronic tooth brushes we considered, this was one of the more economical options and I see any reason to have spent more based on how satisfied we've been with this.",123
688,teeth have never been this clean,4,"got this a year ago. been manual brush user before this. always filthy, grimy teeth when i go to the dentist for dental cleaning. Now, there's hardly anything noticeable on my teeth even after 1 year. (also flossed before brushing). i change the brush head every 2-3 months because the bristles get weak after a while",56
689,Do not drop,3,Yeah it’s my fault. I had it on my desk and moved an object then the toothbrush fell 3 feet. The motor buzzes but doesn’t brush teeth.,27
690,4 sessions max,2,"My older oral b brush held a charge way better than the new one. I regret upgrading, and once it dies it takes forever to charge up enough for one session. Maybe I got a lemon but disappointed that it didn't last as long as my older model. They really don't make em like they used to",57
691,Excellent electric toothbrush.,5,Purchased this a a replacement to my current 10 year old electric toothbrush. My old Oral-B toothbrush wasn’t holding a charge and was running slower. This new one works great and I would recommend this Oral-B electric toothbrush.,38
692,Nice,5,"I used to use a Rotodent but they are hard to get now days. I have several Rotodent brushes and none of them work. The power cord doesn't charge them up and I am unable to find anything comparable to replace the chargers so I can continue to use them. I finally broke down and after much research decided to get the Oral B. I don't like it as well as the Rotodent but as a replacement, it works well.",80
693,So Far So Good,4,"Completly stopped working for no logical reason. And I've passed the date of returning the item. So frustrated, what a waste of money.

UPDATE: change of review from one star to 4 stars. I ended up fixing the rotating brush and have not had any issues since. However, sometimes it will stop suddenly and I assume I'm applying too much pressure when brushing. I'm more satisfied with my purchase.",69
694,Love this thing,5,Just used it for the first time. Much better than I expected. Rotation of the head really feels like it gets into the nooks and crannies.,26
695,Battery Life short,3,"Works well for purpose but having to charge it more often than the 4 year old sonicare it replaced. I used to be able to travel without a charger but will have to with this one.
It's a solid basic toothbrush and like it doesn't come with all the junk extras they try to upsell you on that filled up vanity from past sonicares.",64
696,Doesn't work brand new,1,"It stopped working after one use, battery died and it doesn't charge even though it blinks green when on the charging stand. Don't waste your money on this.",28
697,Does NOT have all features it claims to have!,2,"BUYER BEWARE! I bought the White version of this toothbrush and this black one... BOTH claimed to have two power levels and other features but ONLY the white one has these... even though they claim to be the very SAME toothbrush! So if you want the extra features this one claims to have, get the WHITE 1000 Pro instead. :-( Not happy that this is now outside of the return window or I would surely exchange for what I paid for!",81
698,Toothbrush,5,"Have not used bluetooth feature. Timer is different than what I'm used to....this vibrates after every 30 seconds and slightly longer for 2 mins, whereas the old toothbrush only vibrates at 2 mins. Works very well...first use or two the bristles are very stiff/hard, though after that they do begin to soften some.",53
699,Slippery!,2,"We all know when you brush, you drool. So why didn’t the designers give us something, anything to keep a grip on the handle? During the first use m y hand slid up to the toothbrush head 3 times while brushing, unacceptable.",42
700,Works with most tooth brush heads,5,I haven't tried the Bluetooth feature so the low rating may not apply. The timer feature is a vibration but the vibration is so light that it is a little difficult to feel.,33
701,Ridiculously good value,5,"I'm personally of the opinion that this is a better product than pretty much any, more expensive toothbrush. Oral-B's products included. As of the time I write this review, this seems to use an updated, more effective motor than anything Oral B was using before. It's a great toothbrush.",49
702,A good electrical tooth brush,5,"Been using it for months now and I'm satisfied with it! When I visit the dentist, they mention how nice and clean my teeth are(don't forget about flossing too, that's extremely important haha). The timer is perfect and it's easy to replace the brushes. Just make sure to take the brush top off every time you are done so you can clean the left over tooth paste on the metal.",70
703,"bought in sept, died in Feb.",1,"The toothbrush was working wonderfully. This past weekend it stopped. In the past few weeks I noticed it needed to be charged often. This was the only indication that the toothbrush was malfunctioning. It is past the return date, and I did not buy insurance. Previous electric toothbrushes have lasted for years, so I did not see the need to buy the insurance.
very disappointed",65
704,Great for the money! Love the timer to help you brush!,5,"Love the clean I get with this toothbrush! The timer is great and you can concentrate on cleaning one quadraint of your mouth for :30 then it vibrates and you can move to the next one. This was suggested by my dental hygenist and I highly recommend it. Just be careful because it can feel a bit powerful when first charged up, but the clean feels great on your teeth.",70
705,Love these toothbrushes,5,"My husband is a big fan of this toothbrush. I got him the black and myself the white one. We didn’t use electric brushes before so we can’t compare on that aspect, but we can say that these have improved the color of our teeth. Not sure if that’s due to us brushing for the full 2-minutes for sure, or because of the brushing technique. Either way, we love them!",70
706,Sounds like a JACKHAMMER and is now DEAD,1,"Bought this in May. My first concern was it doesn't ""vibrate"". It is LOUD and actually hurts your teeth if you're not careful. Now, it wont turn on. Shows a full charge, but will not come on. Piece of junk which is shocking from Oral B.",46
707,TERRIBLE battery life,1,"I bought this toothbrush because of the brand and stellar reviews but upon research, the reviews are questionable and the toothbrush is terrible! The bottom of the toothbrush started melting on the charger (I don’t overcharge it) and the better life is a joke! I need to charge it every day!!!",51
708,Digs deep in there!,5,"I haven't used an electric toothbrush since I was a kid, and my memories of those toothbrushes included repeat brushings, but this thing actually works great. Highly recommended!",28
709,BATTERY LIFE IS NO GOOD,1,I got a few uses out of it on over three days without charging. I charged overnight for the first time and it doesn't last longer than 20 seconds anymore. Not happy with product at all.,36
710,2 thumbs up,5,For what I paid I couldn't be more happier with my new toothbrush is efficient and gets the job done only thing its missing is the red light pressure signal that some have still I would recommend this to a friend,41
711,I love my new toothrbush,5,"it makes me laugh reading people reviewing about it being loud - it is not a purring kitten. its an electric toothbrush. and as long as it is cleaning my teeth well, i dont mind that it isnt whisper soft sound. i love mine and my teeth and gums feel super clean and that is whats most important to me! i am very happy with my purchase.",67
712,Great clean feeling For a great price!,5,"This tooth brush leaves my teeth squeaky clean! Im a Dental Assistant and we highly recommend electric tooth brushes, this works wonderfully with out all the extra features. I mean why would anyone need Bluetooth to brush your teeth?! Just move the brush around your mouth thoroughly for 2 minutes at a minimum Thats it!",55
713,Great,5,"Tooth brush works very well,easy to hold cleans the teeth front to back . Hold a charge very long. After use put back on charger and it recharges quickly

Paul.",30
714,Whether you have braces or not this product works great and your teeth will feel pretty clean,5,"I bought this toothbrush after getting braces, and I would say that it definitely saves me some time and energy versus using my ordinary non-electronic toothbrush. Whether you have braces or not this product works great and your teeth will feel pretty clean. It feels a little overwhelming if you haven't used an electric toothbrush before, but I adjusted to it within a day or two. Also, the battery life has never been a problem for me because I leave it on the charger whenever I'm not using it.",89
715,Not worth the money and it wasn't even that much,2,"I wouldn't but this again. I've purchased both Oral B toothbrushes and Sonicare, and I think as long as you buy a quality one they are (can be) good products. This toothbrush's batteries run low fairly quickly. There is only one setting. It's very expensive for what you get, you can definitely get a better one although they do run higher. I was attracted to this one because of the price but I guess you get what you pay for in this instance. I would not really recommend it.",89
716,Very happy with the product.,5,I think this is the best bang for the buck with electric toothbrushes. No bells and whistles but it sure gets the job done.,24
717,"Once You Go Oral B, you can't go back",5,"Awesome Toothbrush.... The only regret you will have is why you didn't get one a long time ago. Love that ""Dentist Office"" clean feeling afterwards. If you never owned an electric toothbrush before, and when you finally get one.... you realize you have been neglecting your teeth and gums.... traditional toothbrushes just can't clean like this. The Oral B product is excellent quality, purchase with confidence.",66
718,Better than a manual brush,3,"Pros:
Works ok for cleaning teeth. It vibrates rather than spins.
Well made
Easy to clean

Cons:
Noisy
Takes a long long time to charge - at least 24hrs
Brush replacements are rather expensive.",34
719,No Pressure Sensor,1,"Apparently from what I see in the questions section, it's random whether any particular black 1000 model has a pressure sensor or not. I got one that didn't. That's ridiculous, given the materials say it has a pressure sensor.",39
720,Electric Toothbrush,4,"I feel this toothbrush covers more surface area of my teeth when cleaning with the smaller circular brush head.. I previously used a Sonic Toothbrush and this one is a lot louder. Also, it doesn't just shut off after 2 minutes of brushing--it just continues to go. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",53
721,"Very Highly Rated, Thick Brush Head",4,Very highly brush but the thick brush head sent me right back to Sonicare. It caused drool to run. It does a good job but it just isn't for me.,30
722,GREAT Cleaning,5,"I have not used an electric toothbrush in decades. I got this because I am procrastinating going to the dentist and I want to clean as good as possible. After only a couple of days, I have already started feeling a difference. Breath is fresher, teeth are smoother. Glad I made the switch.",53
723,Stinky Greetings to your every Morning!,2,"This SUPER noisy, very jittery tool does not feel like it is safe to put in my mouth with all of my fragile dental treatments- unlike the one I purchased for my son- this doesn’t have a hi-lo setting option. Instead, it is FULL throttle, FULL TIME. I’m disappointed in the manufacturing of the actual body, as there is apparent gaps where water gets inand has a chance to get gross, because when I pick it up every am, some gutter-smelling water leaks out onto my hand. Just the start to a new day I was looking to pay a bunch of money (for a freaking TOOTHBRUSH!) for- I mean, who wouldn’t- right?!",113
724,Would Not Complete Charge,1,Received product and allowed battery to charge for 22 hours as per mfg instructions. After 36 hours the charge indicator was still blinking. Obviously defective. Returned.,26
725,Great purchase,5,"I’m a lifetime ORAL B user and this was such an upgrade for me. The battery life lasts at least a week, I do brush a lot. I appreciate the flashing light when its time to recharge the unit. There is only one speed for brushing but its gentle enough for sensitive gums. The look of the brush and the base is modern and not clunky like my last toothbrush which I had for about 5 years. I’ve received so compliments on my teeth since ever since I started using an electric toothbrush. IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM.",99
726,Slippery,3,"The previous versions had a rubbery texture, but the black one I just received has a shrinkwrap like covering that makes it very slippery when wet.",26
727,My 9 year old noticed difference on first use!,5,"Love the timer function. It’s great for my 9 year old too; tells you the time to spend on each quadrant of your mouth. She was previously using a Frozen Oral-B toothbrush and when she started this one, she said she loved it and her teeth felt so clean. I used this after just a regular toothbrush and love it too.",61
728,slippery handle when wet,3,I have almost dropped this practically every time I use it. I don't use the bluetooth idea at all. I would not purchase it again.,25
729,Don't wait too long to replace,4,Working great. I'd waited too long to replace my prior electric Oral-B and had several bad cleanings in a row and finally replaced it and it's working great. Back to few issues. Moral of the story. Even the expensive Oral-B tooth brushes likely only last a 3ish years before they should be replaced. Probably better to just buy a cheaper model and replace it more frequently.,66
730,Stopped charging after less than 6 months,2,This is the second such toothbrush I've purchased. The first Oral B/Braun I used for 10+ years and decided it was time for an upgrade. I got this one -- but it stopped taking a charge in November. I bought it in June.,43
731,Oral B 1000,5,"This was my first time with an electric/batt operated toothbrush. The Oral B is great, it stops when presses too hard and hold a charge for a good time when not plugged in. I would recommend the Oral B!",39
732,Husband loves it,5,All I can say is I bought it for my husband and he loves it and he doesn’t like too many things including me,24
733,This is my 2nd one love it,5,Always my favourite,3
734,Love it!,5,"I absolutely love this toothbrush, it cleans really well, battery life is great and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a new toothbrush and it's affordable.",27
735,Looks like a black rocket ready to launch Way Kool !,5,"Specially like its instant rotation changes. Up & down strokes really take care of business on the gums..
(By the way. Mr. Amazon promised to send me the 8-pack replacement brushes. Still waiting . . .)",36
736,Love Oral B brand,5,"My husband and I absolutely love these electric toothbrushes. We purchased 2 ( 1 for my and 1 for me) . We choose these because we had older versions of these(12 yrs. old) and these have more ""zip"" than the other ones we had. Guess the batteries were on the way out. These have more charge and make your teeth and gums feel very clean. Love oral B' s reputation. Would recommend to anyone.",74
737,save your packaging so you can replace or return it.,1,"if I had saved the packaging I would have just exchanged it. I got this for Christmas and through out the packaging with the wrapping paper, my mistake. I just started using this after New Years and noticed the problem right away. The brush runs intermittently stopping and starting by itself. very annoying! I expect it to die any day.",60
738,Worst product ever !!!!,1,"I bought it few months ago
It was working fine until tonight, it just stopped working? It’s not charging, not turning on, I spent so much money on this? Please help me I am so annoyed!
Worst product ever !!!! I thought oral B is a good name and has decent products, this one has truuely been a disappointment!!!
Biggest regret that I bought this product!!!
DONOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",68
739,Good toothbrush.,4,"Overall, great product: good construction, very small footprint and works like a charm. I opted for the after-market (and much cheaper) bristle heads that looks like a traditional toothbrush than the circular ones it comes in. I figure the more cleaning area, the less work and wear on the circular bristles.",51
740,Nice brush at a nice price,5,"This brush is a great value. I bought this brush to replace a much older and much more expensive Oral-b brush. While it lacks fancy displays and multiple modes like my old brush, I don't miss any of those things. The cleaning performance is actually better than my older brush. It ships with a very good brush head too. Skip the fancy screens, Bluetooth/internet connected brushes. At $35, this does everything you need and does it well.",77
741,Great choice,5,I tried 2 other electric toothbrushes before I got this one. One was much more expensive and one was way less. This one is just as good as the super expensive one and works a lot better than the cheap one.,41
742,First electric toothbrush,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush purchase and it did not disappoint. After using this toothbrush my teeth feel so much cleaner. This product is affordable and is good for anyone who wants to start using or replace their existing electric toothbrush. I have never tried any other brands of electric toothbrush to compare to others. I can certainly say that I got better results with an electric toothbrush and I will never go back to a manual again. I purchased two brushes, one for my husband and one for me. I love it!",94
743,Works well so far!,5,I decided to get an electric toothbrush. This one has worked well so far. It goes a great job of cleaning and is easy to use. We had an older model that was a lot bulkier. I like the little reminder to switch sides.,44
744,Disappointed,3,"Purchased it thinking it would be similiar to my wife's Oral-B but not even close. Granted, it's a lesser price model but it's loud and the brush is quite hard/stiff.",30
745,Does a Great Job Cleaning,5,"I finally took the plunge and gave up on my manual toothbrush, and I am very glad I did...this is a strong, yet smooth way of brushing my teeth, and they do feel so much cleaner now. Wish I would have bought this a long time ago.",47
746,Perfect for kids and adults,5,"My older kids both have one now bc we loved the first purchase so much. Great toothbrush, their teeth get very clean, built in timer is super helpful! Easy to use. Highly recommend.",33
747,Good value & performance,5,"I did not want to go for all the bells & whistles. This one does the job well & I have started to actually enjoy brushing.

The timer function where it momentarily stop vibrating is a bit funny. The only issue I have is that the original charger in the box works on 110V only .... a universal voltage charger is now available on every possible gadget - Oral B should fix this.",73
748,So much better then a manual toothbrush!,5,I love how clean my teeth feel after I am done using this toothbrush. I have only had it for a few days. I’m looking forward to the positive things this will do to help my oral health. I swear after just one use my teeth looked so much cleaner.,50
749,and we are very happy with them,5,"We have three of these Oral-B Pro 1000 rechargeable toothbrushes, and we are very happy with them. Both of my kids have struggled with doing a consistently good job brushing their teeth, and this toothbrush has helped make a huge difference for them to get all the spots that they were missing before! Both kids love how clean and fresh their teeth feel every day (as do I)! My only complaint is that they do get ""build-up"" from water and toothpaste, that requires a good regular wipe-down!",87
750,CAN'T CLEAN TEETH IF IT CAN'T HOLD A CHARGE,1,DOES NOT hold a charge if it is not on its charger 24/7. I have to unplug it to plug in other devices like a hair dryer and if I forget to plug it back in it will be dead by the morning. Even when it is fully charged it only has enough power for 1 full brushing before the battery turns red and the motor slows down. Last night it died in the middle of me brushing and it had been on the charger and unused for 48 hours.,90
751,Good electric toothbrush,4,Pretty reliable like all budget Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Before buying this one I had been using a vitality for almost a decade. I wish they would make it possible for the battery to be substituted once it dies and doesn't charge anymore. One ends up throwing away an otherwise perfectly functioning toothbrush.,52
752,Excellent brush for the price,5,Great electric brush. Dentist-like clean each time you use it. The reminder function is a nice added touch. No negatives about the item whatsoever!,24
753,Oral B brush,4,"It’s a powerful brush but almost too big for my small mouth. I almost always make a mess. The timer part is good but it never shuts off after the quadrant cleaning. That’s okay, I guess, although some brushes go into “overdrive” at that point to polish the teeth. This one doesn’t and I also have no idea how long it actually does stay on.",65
754,Another great Oral B,5,Braun never disappoints. Had my last Oral B for 13 years. Replaced it with this one when the battery gave out on the old one. Works great. Not too aggressive like Sonicare. Hoping this one last as long as the last.,41
755,... dollar version your dentist pushes but it is a nice toothbrush. The replacement heads are cheap and I ...,4,This is not the $100 dollar version your dentist pushes but it is a nice toothbrush. The replacement heads are cheap and I actually liked the bristles on my replacemnts better. Super easy to change out. They take a few hours to recharge. My hubby and i both have one but the battery on his only lasts a week before he has to recharge it whereas mine i recharge every 3 or 4 wreks so thats weird. We are very pleased with our brushes :),85
756,Oral-B Rocks!,5,"My husband and I, transitioned to electric toothbrushes. This changes everything. The price and product is excellent!. It vibrates to indicate you may move to another quadrant and it’s powerful AF. I see no reason to buy a pricey electric toothbrush. Our teeth have never felt so clean until now. Thanks Oral-B!",52
757,Not as advertised,3,"The toothbrush works as fine as any other electronic toothbrush and it does vibrate every 30 seconds. It does not, however, have multiple settings for brushing. It also does not have the sensitivity sensor, which is the only reason I bought this toothbrush. Also takes hours to charge. I’d return it but I threw away the packaging. Not worth $50.",60
758,Why did I wait so long?!,5,I don't know why I never tried this brush earlier but WOW! It's super easy to use and the clean is amazing - you feel like you just left the dentist AND that feeling lasts all day long!,38
759,Very harsh!,2,I have sensitive gums and my dentist recommended an oral be with a sensitive brush head. I bought this toothbrush and a 3 pack of “sensitive” head attachments for it. The brush is WAY too harsh! The motor is loud and the vibrations feel violent on my teeth and gums! Going to try the next step up but so far I’m not impressed with Oral B,66
760,Leaves our teeth glistening,4,"For the price, this is very acceptable. We are accustomed to the two-speed Oral-Bs that we have at home, so this one-speed we bought to keep in our RV took a little getting-used-to. The small base is perfect for tight quarters. It came with two heads, so we just swap them between uses. It holds a charge well and is sufficiently powerful to leave our teeth glistening at the campground. I love electric toothbrushes and my dentist says they are the best at keeping teeth and gums in good shape.",90
761,Much Better Than The Competition,5,"After previously using another popular brand, I switched to this Oral-B. After the first use, my teeth felt like they do immediately after a cleaning at the dentist office. Because the head is small and round, I now can easily get behind the back molars and inside the front teeth which were problem areas before. The difference is amazing. The downside is that this brush is loud and sounds like a grinder. Worth it for cleaner teeth.",77
762,More powerful than my old one.,4,My old Oral-B stopped working after almost 20 years and I purchased this as a replacement. It is much more powerful than my old one. Very glad to see the return to the round brush head.,36
763,Works for few minutes,4,After using this product for the first few minutes it’s cuts off for a few second and than start working again I already charge the battery several times and still having the issue,33
764,Weak battery,2,"Very weak battery capacity. Need to charge after 5 times of use, I only use once per day, and it takes almost 24 hours to charge, very slow. It is also very loud when use.",35
765,Ok for the price,3,"I have their other model thats more pricey for my house and got this for back up at my boyfriends house, doesn't work as well but gets the job done.",30
766,Works great.,5,This is the best electric toothbrush I've ever used. I like its stopping and letting me know if I'm pushing it against my gums too hard.,26
767,"Does the job very well, but could use better battery indicators",4,"Great toothbrush. It's not that important, since it sits on its charger when not in use, but I wish it gave an indication of how much battery life remains.",29
768,and it's great! It is a little loud and vibrate-y,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush, and it's great! It is a little loud and vibrate-y, but I don't have anything to compare it to, so it might just be me. Cleans teeth well, and has a really helpful timer every 30 seconds. So far, all the charging info has been true (did take the full 24 hrs or something to charge all the way, but then I've been able to use it without charging for about a week). Overall good purchase!",82
769,Lightweight and compact,5,"The size is good for small hands, lightweight. It is compact and fits nicely in a small space. It is a bit loud.",23
770,good toothbrush but LOUD,3,"I really wanted to like this toothbrush but I couldn't get past the noise. I've used a SoniCare for years and liked the idea of changing to the Oral-B because of the circular motion. It seemed to do a fine job cleaning my teeth, but it's really loud. Ended up returning it",52
771,amazing clean feeling.,5,"Bought this to replace an Oral-B unit that i've had for over 8 years. The unit was still working but was losing charge. Replaced with this unit. We love it. unbelievable power and teeth feel cleaner. I've always used the crossaction head brush, love that one also",47
772,Not the best,1,"I ordered this toothbrush, and when I went to use it for the first time, I thought it would be wonderful!!!!! But to my amazement it is a very messy toothbrush to use, as well as when your brushing your teeth the whole brush drags down when your are brushing!!!! I keep it on the charger all the time, so the bogging down, is not because it needs to be charged!!!!!",71
773,difficult to use,4,"my dentist recommended it, so I bought it. formerly I used a Sonicare. because of the wider neck to the brush, you end up drooling/dripping a lot more. I need to actually wipe my chin while brushing. Also, the sonicare automatically stopped at 2 minutes of brushing. this one keeps going until you turn it off.",56
774,Battery life sucks,2,I've had my brush for about 10 months. At the beginning I was able to go for a week on the battery life. Now the battery has gone bad and it works only for a minute. I'm surprised that Braun put such a crappy battery in this product. My Braun shaver is over 10 years old and still going strong. I hope that manufacturer reads these poor reviews and does something positive about them.,74
775,Overhyped and mediocre,1,"This replaced a fancier model (TRIUMPH PROFESSIONAL) that I bought from my dentist in 2012. After two Oral-Bs, I'm ready to go back to Sonicare for good. There are two major problems with Oral-B brushes: one, they only really clean well at 100% battery charge—the dropoff in cleaning power is shocking if you don't charge them after every use. Two, the various holes in the brush heads make them extremely hard to keep clean. After every use I rinse out the brush head AND run the brush under water, but it's futile. As soon as I put it back down to charge, all manner of nasty grey-brown goo leaks from the head down the handle and onto the charging base, where it forms a ring of filth that has to be scrubbed off every few days. This may not sound like a big deal, and perhaps if you love cleaning things it isn't.

For me, the constant need to clean the brush itself is demoralizing and makes brushing with an Oral-B MORE of a chore than using a manual toothbrush. Does it clean better than a manual toothbrush? Yes, if you keep it fully charged. Yet when you factor in how much harder it is to keep clean than an ordinary toothbrush, it doesn't really save any labor, and in my view a tool that creates more labor than it saves is a bad tool.",235
776,Much more powerful than the old one I had.,5,"I LOVE this. I had an older version of the Oral B electric toothbrush, and when the (non-replaceable) rechargeable battery in it could no longer BE recharged, I bought this newer version. It is much more powerful than my old one and really feels like it cleans my teeth a LOT better. I also like that you can use NON-rechargeable batteries in it, if necessary, like on long camping trips!",70
777,This new Braun Pro 1000 toothbrush is a Braun scam,1,"I've been using Braun electric toothbrushes since 2007. One can expect a battery not to last forever. No problem. One can send the toothbrush to a company who installs new batteries. But these new ones: PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE! If the bottom where the battery is contained is opened, the whole toothbrush is destroyed! Braun is most happy to take your money as often as possible. I'm switching companies. Shame on you, Braun.",71
778,Not Impressed....,2,"...in fact, I'm a bit disappointed. This is my first Oral B and I was expecting more. It does not keep a charge for 7 days as claimed - more like 4 with a single user. Plus, it's noisy; sounds like it will fall apart into pieces. And for someone with a smaller mouth, the brush is a little large to reach far back teeth.",65
779,Excellent quality and value,5,I upgraded my old Oral-B electric toothbrush that I had for several years and this new toothbrush has Worked really well for several months. I like the timer function and it holds its charge if I forget to charge it after a few days. I definitely feel like my mouth gets a deep cleanse using this toothbrush and my gum health has been great overall,65
780,"Finally, a real powerful tooth brush that works wonders!",5,The rotary toothbrush works like it should. Powerful enough to get into the deep spaces between teeth.,17
781,It does what it should do well,5,I get a really good clean from this. When I brush my teeth one little teeth never gets done right and now I don’t have to worry about missing one. I don’t know how much plaque is removed but my teeth feels so slick. My battery died after 2 days I believe and I thought it last a little longer not sure.,62
782,I highly recommend this product for other people,5,I really like this product it deep cleans my teeth very well they're no longer yellow than now brilliantly White and I like the timing feature for one side of the mouth to the other mouth in 2 minute intervals,40
783,Dentist recommended,5,"My dentist told me I had a lot of plaque this time. Then tried to sell me an electric toothbrush. I probably wouldn't have believed it except for the X-rays and time the hygienist took scraping.

I turned theirs down and found a better priced one on Amazon. Plus, this one matches my bathroom! Love it and makes my teeth feel so much cleaner!",64
784,Totally worth the money,4,"A good step up from the $20 off-brand model I picked up in the grocery store on a whim. Really cleans between teeth and scrubs the gums. The difference between this brush and a cheap ""vibrating"" brush is noticeable immediately.

My only complaint is that it is probably a bit rough for some people. I don't have sensitive gums, but you definitely feel this one.",65
785,Kudos to Braun/OralB for your warranty service,5,"I purchased one of these devices in May 2017 (it was different than the one shown here). Once it failed to work properly, I realized I still had time on the two-year warranty. I sent it in for repair - at their cost (after discussions with Braun customer service). Lo and behold, they replaced it with a brand new one (the newer one pictured here).",65
786,"like, you can feel the smoothness of the enamel ...",5,"This gets your teeth noticeably cleaner, like, you can feel the smoothness of the enamel on your teeth after using this, almost like a dentist professional cleaning. You don't get that same feeling with a regular toothbrush.

I wish it had auto shut off after two minutes instead of the short stop and go it does at its 'quadrant intervals', or some kind of control for the timer. Aside from that would recommend.",73
787,It Hurts,3,"Even on low, this thing hurt way too much for me. It made my gums bleed. If you have tender gums as I do, I'd recommend one of these that had a much wider range of pressure settings.",38
788,"Powerful, easy setup",5,"This product was easy to unbox, easy to setup and easy to use. It does come with instructions and mine came with a coupon for more brush heads.
It’s powerful and cleans very well.
I bought this toothbrush to replace my old one. The old one is just over a year old and not an Oral B. It was on its last legs.",63
789,Sparkling white!,5,"After 2000 years my old Braun electric toothbrush finally gave up the ghost. I bought the Oral-B Black Pro 1000 because of the modest price and many positive reviews. So far I'm pleased with my purchase. The base is small and attractive (shrug, it's a toothbrush) and a flashing green light indicates when it is charging. The well-packaged toothbrush shipped and arrived quickly.

The Oral-B only comes with a single brush so I also sprung for an eight-pack of replacement heads.The Oral-B cleaned my gums and got my teeth sparkling white, but you should still floss to get the gunk between your teeth; no toothbrush gets in there.

Downside? It does a little ""hesitation"" thing every 30 seconds to remind you to start on a different quadrant. I find it rather annoying and wish I could turn it off, but I'm not removing any stars.

Anyway, this is a solid five star product. If I ever have an problem I'll update right away.",163
790,Works great,5,"Love this 'new model' replacing my previous older model of 7 yrs. Nice casing, easier to keep ahold of. And much quieter! I'm very pleased with my purchase.",28
791,Overall it's great!,5,"Works great, keeping a charge about 12 days with brushing 3x a day. The timer is a bit annoying. Overall except for the replacement brush cost, I think it's great.",30
792,Died in 3 months,1,Tooth brush will not charge after 3 months of use.,10
793,Love the timer and the clean feeling after brushing,5,My old Oral B was apx 10 years old...it was a professional with 2 toothbrush units and only 1 charger. It still worked perfectly but we wanted 2 single units so we purchased 2 of these.... Igit the white one my husband the black one..They work perfectly....great price...great products.,49
794,"Durable Quality, Simple Design",5,"Simple electric toothbrush. I don’t need a Bluetooth connected brush, that just makes my life more complicated. Works great, same model (technically they might have changed the model #, but it looks the same as what) I had before, which lasted years.",42
795,"never had a oral b toothbrush before, had electric toothbrushes,",4,"but I did notice a considderable difference, gums felt better, teeth smootheer and cleanerl Feel
like the teeth are actually getting the cleaning I had hoped for from the other brushes.
Won't buy anything but oral b in future/",39
796,I'll never go back to reg tooth brush,5,Got after cavities and root canal. Will never go back to regular brush. Why don't more ppl talk about how effective these are??!!!! A must buy.,26
797,Way too strong. Bad for your gums.,1,"My last electric toothbrush had 2 speeds. I would use the stronger one for my teeth and slower one for my guys. This thing has 1 speed and it’s about 3x the speed and intensity as the stronger one on my last brush. Way too intense, not healthy for gums at all.",52
798,Works Great!,5,"I have never used an electric brush before but now I don't think I can go back. This brush does a better job than I was ever able to with a regular brush and I like the timer function. It lets you know when you're at 30, 60, and 90 seconds with a different pulse of the vibration that's very obvious and then at 2 minutes it does that pulse 4 times.",72
799,Works great!,5,"Along with flossing, this toothbrush has been great for my improving my dental health. The pulse timer every 30 seconds is a great idea.",24
800,Okay but noisy,3,The tooth brush seems to work as expected. It is very Noisy. I used a sonic care in the past which was a little more expensive but left my teeth feeling like I had a profession cleaning. This one doesn’t really compare. I guess it is fine for the price but not sure I would buy again.,57
801,Great brush,5,Very happy with this toothbrush. I was replacing an old oral-b sonic complete. This one cleans much better and does a much better job at keeping plaque under control. It took a little while to get used to the larger brush. Brushing with this style is a little messier as well. Need to stay at the sink and not be wandering around. Very good value for the cost.,68
802,This Oral B 1000 Toothbrush is Wonderful!,5,"This toothbrush does such a good job and after you brush your teeth, it feels as though you have had a great professional dental cleaning. I would not waste my money on one more expensive because this one does all you need. I only wish the brush bristles were just a little softer but they are not bad. I think once I use it a little more, I will get use to it. I really do not have any real complaints.",81
803,All the toothbrush I need!,5,"Why pay more? Big upgrade over my old one of the same brand and model. Lighter, sleeker, more powerful with better battery life.",23
804,Battery doesn’t last long,2,The battery doesn’t last very long. I brush my teeth two or three times a day and I have to charge it almost daily.,24
805,Love this thing,5,"Don't know how I lived without this. My teeth feel dentist clean after I use this toothbrush, the only drawback I have is setting it on the base correctly, you can set it on there backwards and it won't charge. I nearly sent the item back because I was initially not placing it on the charger correctly. Once I figured that out it has been nothing short of amazing.",69
806,So far so good,5,"Gives a great clean and I like how it buzzes every 30 seconds so you can clean each part of your mouth evenly. My only complaint would be that when you put it back on the charger, the front of it flashes brightly while it's charging. This is really distracting at night. I've covered it with electrical tape.",58
807,"Great value, awesome product!",5,"Quick shipping, great value! This toothbrush does a great job and the ability to replace the brush heads saves me money over buying the power disposable brushes. I also love that I was able to send in for a $10 off coupon for replacement heads. All in all, I’m very happy with this purchase.",54
808,Really Good!,5,"It has a two minute timer, and what is awesome about it is that it is set to 30 second intervals so you can brush teeth sections as you like.",30
809,This is the one to get..!,5,"This one is a keeper! I changed my brand from Sonic to Oral B and I’m glad I did. It feels that this does a better job and I like the timers on it , makes brushing more efficient...!",39
810,Cleans well for a good price.,5,"Hopefully this one lasts longer than the previous one I owned (1.5 years). Love the brand, the design, and the price of the heads. Dentist has loved the results. So I am happy.",33
811,Updated review,4,"I posted a negative review about this product a couple of days ago which I subsequently discovered was a case of operator error. The toothbrush works fine! It takes the full two minutes, but it works.",36
812,Great for pushers.,5,I like this toothbrush because it has a sensitivity indicator that stops when you push too hard on your teeth and gums. I have not used the timer or Bluetooth.,30
813,Pearly Whites,5,"I've had this brush for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with it. It's keeping my teeth as if I just left the dentist's office. As a matter of fact, my dentist told me to keep using it as it made a difference in my check-up! My only concern is that it seems to take so long to charge. I put it on the charger once a week overnight and it's still not fully charged in the morning. It's 10am today and green light is still flashing! Other than my concern about that, this is a great product.",101
814,We all like it a lot,5,I purchased 3 of these toothbrushes! One for each myself and my kids! We all like it a lot! I would “Highly” recommend using this toothbrush over any other! I have used many expensive power toothbrushes including other oral-B more expensive power toothbrushes and this one is by far my favorite and the price is very generous as well. It stays charged 4-6 days with use 2-3 times per day. You will not regret this purchase!,76
815,Oral B is Awesome - From Cavities to Zero for Years!,5,"Love this Toothbrush!!! We have used Oral B for years. Our 6 kids would have cavities until we used this - no more cavities for several years and their dentist comments on how they have zero plaque build up! Our kids ages are 3-17 and then us adults use it. If you have sensitive gums like me keep using it but for lesser time and your gums will get used to it - I use it regular time now. Our daughter has nasal polyps and is the only one who can’t use this as it makes them bleed and get irritated. We will never go back to manual toothbrushes! We also love that we can use generic brush heads and the brushes are circle to fit easier in smaller mouths unlike other brands. I will say their brush heads do fit better as the generic brush heads we have used are very tight and harder to remove. Hope this helps somebody.

Update 5 years later: we are still a family using this amazing electric toothbrush and still zero cavities for our kids. It makes cleaning their teeth so easy and thorough. I don’t care for their brush heads though but this is awesome. I don’t think I could ever go back to a manual toothbrush again. I will say our 17 year old daughter has nasal polyps and cannot use this as it makes those polyps bleed so she uses a manual toothbrush. No issues for anyone else. Just make sure to not brush right after eating as your enamel is softer and these are so powerful!",267
816,Cheap design,3,I had this product for about 3 years. Battery life is pretty horrible after time. One day it just died out. Never worked again. I went and bought the Phillips Soni care. Seems light years better,36
817,It’s alright,3,"Used to have a SonicCare…thought I’d try something else. This performs ok, my bar is just a little higher.",19
818,Love this!,5,This toothbrush was a stocking stuffer For my boyfriend and he loves it! I have one myself and wanted him to have one as well. It was cheaper than buying in store and arrived very quickly. I don’t think we will ever go back to a normal toothbrush!,48
819,It will work like you have never seen before. Great item.,5,This is one great toothbrush! I used an Oral B for many years. It worked great until just recently. That was the only one I ever had and now I have this new one and it is wonderful. A really great toothbrush to help with daily care. So much more improved over the previous older model.,56
820,My teeth are extemely clean and my breath is fresh after each use of this electric toothbrush.,5,"I did not dislike any feature. I have used electric toothbrushes for the last 15 years. The first Oral-B lasted for fifteen years and I bought the new Oral-B last month. I brush my teeth four times a day. The brush is easy to keep clean, I like the blinking light on it that shows me it is charging. I highly recommend this manner of brushing teeth.",67
821,The Best,5,I was using another electric toothbrush that did a good job of cleaning my teeth but my teeth did not feel clean. Now my entire mouth feels great!,28
822,I love these brushes,5,"This is my third Oral-B. I love these brushes. My dentist says whatever you are doing.....keep it up!! Your teeth feel great after brushing....and its way better for your gums than rubbing an old school brush across them. They charge and stay charged for over a week. So just toss it in the drawer and the light tells you when the charge is getting low. I have one in my suitcase for travel as well. Amazon sells the replacement heads for a good price as well, so you are all set!!!",91
823,Woo!,5,"I love this toothbrush. I recently had to have nearly all of my teeth worked on due to a combination of poor brushing, nonexistent flossing and years of a lot of sugar. This has helped me so much in making sure I am brushing the full two minutes and that I am brushing each quadrant for the same amount of time (by the helpful off-tempo notification vibrations). My dentist was happy to see the improvement (along with flossing) that this has had on my teeth!",85
824,Basic Electric toothbrush,5,Had a Diamond Clean Sonic toothbrush which quit working after 3 years so went back to an Oral B. Good basic everyday cleaning toothbrush with 2 minute timer. Does the job!,31
825,Happy Oral-B customer for 17 years,5,"I had my last Oral-B toothbrush for 16 years before it finally died. I thought that one was good, but this one is way better. Yes, as other reviewers have said, it’s a bit louder than my old one. But it’s actually more powerful than my old one, and I’m super pleased. I’m used to the noise and hardly notice it now. I haven’t tried the Bluetooth connectivity (still not entirely sure what that’s for?) but maybe I’ll check it out in all my free time when I’m bored (lol).",90
826,Short battery life,4,This is my second Oral B 1000 toothbrush. After a year both required charging more frequently. Initially a charge would last for a week (twice a day use) but after a year 3-4 days. Replacement heads are expensive.,38
827,Works great!,5,"Great electric toothbrush for a deep clean of your teeth, making them feel fresh and clean.",16
828,Great cleaning action.,5,"I am very pleased with this product. I got the ""cross action"" head and I really like it. It gets into areas that my basic toothbrush did not. It's fun to brush my teeth!!! My dentist actually recommended this brand. It came in the mail the day after my last cleaning. The timer works perfectly. I love this product. My teeth actually look whiter although I could just be imagining that. Lol 😆",73
829,Vibrations are kinda harsh,1,"Vibrations are very strong and it is kinda large, wasn’t a fan at all and am no longer using",19
830,It is great.,5,It is very powerful. It feels like a really deep clean. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.,18
831,Great Electric Toothbrush so far.,5,Purchased for my mother. She doesn’t have Bluetooth so I can’t say about that function. Otherwise the toothbrush is great. She likes how clean her teeth feel after using it. She also likes the timer so she knows when to move on to another section of her mouth. Great toothbrush.,50
832,Works well but only lasted 3 years,3,"Did a great job cleaning my teeth. Less plaque and cavities at visits. However, lasted a little less than 3 years for me until the motor stopped working properly. I tried to get it repaired but the shop that does official repairs for Braun indicated repairs are not possible - just have to buy a new one.",57
833,This is a powerfully effective product for teeth cleaning.,5,"Charge only seems to last for 3 days. I just keep it on the charger continuously after each use. My teeth get a deep cleaning after every brushing. Gums are also improved. Vibration is quite strong, takes some getting used to. After several weeks, I've adjusted.",46
834,Just OK,2,"Not happy with this Oral B product. I owned an Oral B toothbrush for about 10 years and LOVED it, but it finally died so I replaced it with this unit. I am not happy at all. It does not hold a charge well, and its not as powerful as my older unit. Sad that the Braun Oral B standards of excellence have faded over the years :-(",68
835,The right brush for me.,5,"Dentist gave me the choice of this, the ultrasonic one or the periodontist. I chose this and have no regrets. Takes a while (12 hours) to charge fully but the charge lasts for weeks.",34
836,Does not turn off after 2 minutes.,1,"All my previous electric brushes turns off after brushing for two minutes, but not this one also, it never charges to full.",22
837,Nice Toothbrush,5,My dental hygienist suggest going electric. This was my first electric toothbrush. I wish I had switched over sooner.,19
838,My teeth have never felt more clean,5,"this toothbrush is amazing. my teeth feel extremely clean and fresh after each use, and they're getting much whiter than they were with my manual brush. the only cons are the timed pulses that let you know ""when to switch"" to a different part of your mouth bc, please let me just brush the way i want to. i don't need your pulses, get out of here. still, that's not enough to make me not love this toothbrush, and i also really like that it's rechargeable on its little stand so that i don't have to buy batteries.",98
839,Weak motor,2,"I would never buy a toothbrush from this company again. The motor has no power to it my old toothbrush motor has more power than the brand new one.
It makes no difference whether it has a full charge or not, the power and speed is very limited. Very disappointing",50
840,Great buy!,5,I love this toothbrush! This is my first ever electric toothbrush and I don't think I could ever go back to a manual. I love the size and how comfortable it is to hold. The brush head is great and does wonders on my teeth. The 2 minute timer is incredibly handy for me and has made it much easier to brush all four quadrants of my mouth evenly.,69
841,Very nice- hav enjoyed having it.,4,Used for personnel home use. If your hand gets wet while using switch is a little hard to turn off. Really good for your gms,25
842,Garbage!!!😡,1,Stopped working after 3 usage. It would not change. Smh. Garbage.. would not recommend,14
843,Best electric toothbrush I’ve used,5,Love the smaller round brush. It seems to clean teeth better especially at the gum line.,16
844,Can't keep charge,1,"I've purchased many Oral B toothbrushes but I'm done now. Every brush lasts less time than the previous one. I've had this one for 7 months and it can't keep a full charge for more than a couple of days. Even when fully charged it vibrates at a reduced speed, as if in slow motion.",55
845,Two different ratings,1,"I ordered a black one for my husband, and a white one for myself. (Color has nothing to do with problems/lack of problems, but I had to choose one to evaluate.) My husband's toothbrush is still working fine. My quit taking a charge after less than two weeks. I guess performance is a pretty random thing with these toothbrushes.",59
846,Gets your teeth clean,5,Good electric toothbrush. Like that ot lets you know when you've brushed 2 minutes in 30 second intervals. This is my 2nd one as the first one quit working after 5 years.,32
847,Change my Life,5,"I can't believe I have lived 27 years on this Earth without an Oral-B toothbrush. The way it massages my teeth is truly life changing. I full hearty believe with all my being that it has reversed and cured the 4 cavities my dentist told me I had. This brush has whitened my teeth so much I'm sure their shine can be seen from the moon. I feel like singing the ""Shiny Teeth and Me"" song and an inspire to brush at all hours of the day. This has inspired me to change my career to dental field. I am a changed woman because of this brush and you will be too! I highly recommend! 320/10 #gish",117
848,Cleans well but the charge is weak,3,This toothbrush cleans your teeth well. The one problem I’m having is it does not stay charged as long as I’d like it to. Needs to be charged every 3 days.,31
849,Pressure sensor? What pressure sensor?,2,"One of the main selling points of this toothbrush was the fact that it had a pressure sensor. Well, it doesn't work. I sent back the first one I received, thinking it was defective.... But the sensor didn't work on the replacement, either, unless it is so subtle as to be unnoticeable. The brush itself is great, which is why I am not leaving a one star review.",68
850,Buy this now. Upfront cost to save dentist bills.,5,I had a sonic care that was getting old. I went to the dentist and a chunk of tarter fell in my mouth. It was terrible. I have zero cavities and take good care of my teeth. I ordered this brush hoping to reduce the buildup on my teeth. Man o man. This is like going to the dentist two times per day. My teeth have never looked so good. Do yourself a favor and get one of these.,79
851,It's AMAZING,5,"This has changed the way I view oral health. I brushed with my old toothbrush after a week of using this and wondered how I never got cavities before. This leaves me feeling ""post dentist"" clean every time. Also my wife and I share the body and just bought different brushes since they have colored rings on them and the head is so easy to remove. Highly recommend.",68
852,Well Worth The Cost.,5,My gums have been receding for a few years. Since I have been using this for 2 minutes twice a day my gums are coming back. Dentist recommended it. I'm surprised and delighted. I'll never use a regular tooth brush again.,41
853,"New in September 2018. Now, inconsistent brush rotation and no longer holding a charge.",1,"We have two earlier models of the Oral-B Pro 1000. They are three years old and work fine. Our daughter wanted one for herself and we purchased the Oral-B Pro 1000 for her in September 2018. By October, it was not consistently rotating as it should and by November it is not holding a charge. .",56
854,I love this Electric toothbrush because it is light weight,5,"I love this Electric toothbrush because it is light weight, easy to clean, and does a good job of cleaning my teeth. This is the first Electric toothbrush I've owned and it is worth the money so far. I also like that you can never overcharge it due to safety installed functions of the charger. After use just set it on the charger, leave it plugged into the electrical socket and walk away. It's alway ready to use.",78
855,Reason for the loud noise.,3,"I kind of like the toothbrush, the thing i hate is that it is super loud, the reason for that is that the actual brush head slips out of the habdle just enough that their is enough room for it to rattle and making alot of noise. Very bad designe, oral b engineers suck apparantly.",55
856,Two bad ones in a row,1,"The first one was DOA, the second one failed right after the return window closed.

Something chronically wrong here with either the assembly process or the components.",27
857,Cleans teeth,5,"My hygienist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush but didn't specify a brand. I thought I'd try the Oral-B. It cleans my teeth really well and it has helped my gums too, I'm sure my next dental appointment will go a little better!",44
858,Teeth feel cleaner than ever!,5,I bought this because my dentist recommended that I switch to an electric toothbrush. It took some getting used to since I've used a manual brush my entire life until now. I've used it for a few months and my dentist told me during my last cleaning that my teeth barely had any build-up on them. This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling like you just had a cleaning. I love the fact that it vibrates to let you know when to move on to a new section of your mouth. I don't find it overly loud and the comfort is great. Charging is super easy and the battery lasts me about a week (brushing two times a day). I would definitely recommend and would purchase this again.,127
859,Two thumbs up,5,"You know that feeling as you walk out of the Dentist after a cleaning, where you know your teeth will never be that clean again, until your next cleaning? This toothbrush cleans my teeth to that level. It is honestly amazing the difference between this brush and expensive manual brushes I have purchased in the past. WILL NEVER GO BACK. Awsome product and great price.",65
860,Life changing!,5,This tooth brush has changed my life! It nearly cleans as well as a professional cleaning.,16
861,Bad charger,1,The charger doesn't work,4
862,From a Dental Hygienist : excellent brush!,5,Like the small brush head and strong brushing action - feels as though they were just polished at the dentist's office! I would still recommend an air flosser as well as this brush,33
863,"Batteries are Nimh, not lithium, but deliver plenty of power for several extended brushings",5,"I like the simplicity and power. I don't want an IOT toothbrush. It turns on, it turns off, its attractive, and has a compact charger. What else do you need? It has a 30 second frequency pulse to time yourself. I think that's unnessecary. The head that comes with it is nice. It's lasting longer than the pack of generics I bought.",62
864,Nice,5,Love this toothbrush! Love that it’s rechargeable and you don’t have to use batteries!,14
865,Great Product,5,I love this toothbrush. Works efficiently and does the job - always an Oral B purchaser!!,16
866,Underpowered,1,"I constantly have problems with the brush binding up and not spinning because I put toothpaste on the brush. Thought it was the head, so I replaced that, still had problems. Unless I am extremely careful to just barely lay the toothpaste on the brush it bogs down and doesn’t spin.",51
867,Perfect timing for perfect brushing,5,I love the timing hints on this toothbrush. It lets you know when you've reached all your areas and brushed enough! I love it... such a good cleaning!,28
868,Good brush head- other features nonexistent,2,Love the oscillating brush head. Dislike that the features aren’t of quality. The “timer” is nonexistent and the pressure sensor is simply a programmed response. The brush will stop oscillating at the same time each time you brush it to make you think it is accurately sending your pressure. The features suck and it is advertised as something it isn’t,60
869,Poor battery performance,3,The brush works fine but the battery doesn't last long at all. I do not even get a week out of it,22
870,Good value but not as powerful,4,"The pro 1000 version doesn't feel as powerful as my pro 9600, although rated for 8800 rotations per second. The timer doesn't reset if the previous use did not end in exactly 2 minutes. Otherwise all good.",37
871,My husband loves this toothbrush,5,"He seems pretty happy with the feel and usage of this electric toothbrush. So, as the significant other, who happens to sleep next to him, with his hot breath in my face, I will say that this works wonderfully!",39
872,Seems to work great,5,"This seems to be very well made, it works great so far. It wasn't crazy expensive. That's all I'm looking for.",21
873,Excellent toothbrush.,5,The brush head feels big but does a great job. I've used an electric toothbrush for years and this is the best one I've tried. I actually feel like I've been to the dentist for a cleaning every time I use it.,42
874,The pressure sensor doesn't work,1,"I bought this toothbrush specifically for the pressure sensor feature. However, it doesn't work. I tried calling the Oral B support number, and they want me to send in this toothbrush, they'll look at it, and send a replacement 5-7 business days later. Unfortunately, I need to use a toothbrush more frequently than every 2 weeks. So I'll need to order/buy a separate toothbrush for that time. If I wanted to spend that extra money, I would have just gotten a better toothbrush.",83
875,Best brush ever,4,"Never going to manual again.
Dentist is impressed at how clean the teeth are are.

One thing to note, this doesn't do the ""sensitive pressure"" thing it states so no clue what's that's about.
That's why a 4 star and not a 5",43
876,Good Toothbrush for The Price!,5,Does the job for a good price. I love how clean my teeth feel with the deep clean. I do wish the battery lasted longer. This model does not have Bluetooth connectivity.,32
877,Flippin Loud and Sorta Rough,2,Only used once-- This thing sounds like a wood chipper and feels like one to in your mouth. It seemed to clean good but frankly scared me out how loud it is. Once I figured out the right pressure against my teeth the roughness of the rotation seemed to get better.,51
878,There is no pressure sensor.,3,"Product description talks about a pressure sensor, but the box makes no mention of this, nor is there any apparent pressure sensor on the brush itself.",26
879,"Works really well, affordable, loud",4,"Pros:
- Leaves teeth feeling really clean
- The vibrating alert really does seem to help you spend more time on each quadrant
- Seems to work better than ones that simply vibrate (without rotating)
- Battery lasts for long enough that I don't even bother to bring the charger when traveling

Cons
- It's fairly loud",57
880,Teeth are whiter and plaque buildup that I had to spend time on with floss and brushing specific area is pretty much gone in less than a week of daily,5,"Never going back to manual ever again. Teeth are whiter and plaque buildup that I had to spend time on with floss and brushing specific area is pretty much gone in less than a week of daily brushing. I will say that the timer kinda sucks because if you don't stop exactly when it tells you to, the next time you go to brush it won't reset the timer and still remembers where you last left off",77
881,Great Toothbrush,5,"I love this toothbrush. I was way better than any other toothbrush I have had in the past. It does take me a little longer in the morning to brush my teeth, however my teeth feel very clean when I use this toothbrush. I loved the toothbrush so much I even brought my wife a matching one and she loves it as well. I would fully recommend this product to anyone.",71
882,Great,5,Haven't had any plaque build up since I've been to the dentist after purchasing one of these. Great stuff.,19
883,Excellent toothbrush,5,"I'm very happy with the Oral-B electric toothbrush and really like the timer feature. Since I bought it and use it twice daily, I have noticed a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth as well as a very noticeable reduction in tartar on my teeth. I only wish I had bought one sooner!",55
884,Works better than non-rotating brush heads,5,"I previously owned an electric toothbrush but, at the advice of my dentist, purchased one with a rotating brush head. Not only do I get the sense that my teeth are now really clean after brushing, but my dental check-ups are great and my hygienist thinks I'm a star!
Very comfortable to use and I'm getting terrific results. Very glad I made the switch.",64
885,Charger died after 1 month.,1,"The charge only lasted a few days at a time, it’s feels harsh on the gums, and it stopped working after 1 month. I’m glad I didn’t throw out my 3 year old Philips Sonicare.",35
886,Something we all must have.,5,I been using the brush for awhile now and it does help easier clean those areas on the back our mouth that are hard to reach. I am satisfied with this purchase.,32
887,"Great toothbrush overall, but I wanted a black charger!!",3,"Great charger, but I accepected a black charger, not white! That's why I bought the black in the first place!",20
888,VIBRATIONAL TOOTHS,5,"I was using spinbrushes for the past 5-6 years which worked OK, started looking for something a step up, these match my décor & work very well, overall I am happy with the purchace. replacement OE heads are ridiculous in price, did a bunch of review reading here on amazon & found some that I ordered for a fraction of the price that work just as well as the originals.",70
889,"Bought one for every member of the family. Clean, healthy teeth!",5,I received this toothbrush as a gift from my dentist. I liked it so much bought one for every member of my family. Dental hygienist was impressed with how clean their teeth were on this last visit. Great toothbrush and they last a long time.,45
890,Save your teeth,5,Your teeth dont die a natural death. You kill them! This is a dental hygienist in your hand!,18
891,Works great but slippery,4,Very slippery when wet but works great. Had to put a rubber band around it to keep it from slipping out of my hand.,24
892,Excellent quality!,5,Just wanted a simple electric toothbrush. No bells and whistles. This is perfect and all I need.,17
893,Best Toothbrush ever!,5,"At 1st, I wasn't sure how I'd like it being that this was my 1st Electric Toothbrush. But I ended up loving it! Will be buying another for my husband",30
894,"Great clean, dead in a year",3,"It worked great for a year, then stopped charging when on the dock (even though the battery light was flashing green). Disappointed that this died in just one year.",29
895,Best basic electric toothbrush,5,"I've had this for over half a year and it is still working like new, and I brush twice a day. My favorite thing is that the charge pad doesn't concave in for an easier cleaning process. I absolutely love the timer to help me keep in the two-minute brush b/c it vibrates every 30 seconds for each section of the mouth.",62
896,Great toothbrush!,5,Really like this brush and my dentist has noticed I get a much better clean. Would definitely recommend,18
897,Clean like a dental checkup !,5,"Clean your yeah so good, they feel and are so clean and bright, it’s like coming from the dentist checkup 2 times a day !!!",25
898,My teeth sparkle,5,Wirecutter recommended this toothbrush and it works fantastically. My teeth still feel clean at 5 PM!,16
899,"Works fine, but…",4,"Works fine. Believe it should have an indicator for low battery, does not, just quits.",15
900,First time using a electric toothbrush,5,"As far as the functions or Bluetooth or timer function, I do not use that. But, as for brushing regularly I love it!
I can't wait to go to the dentist for my check-up. I want to brush my teeth more than before! I have had no problems, out of the box and plug in.",55
901,Amazing Affordable Toothbrush :),5,"Many of us have bought the cheap WalMart battery powered brushes. Do yourself a favor and put it away as a spare. Not only is this brush so much more powerful. I love how I never have to deal with replacing more AA batteries. Also included were some coupons and even more of a discount for taking a minute to register. Thanks, Oral-B!",63
902,perfect for your pearly whites,5,"I ordered this toothbrush a year ago and it is still going strong. I love using this toothbrush, my teeth feel cleaner after each use. I typically only recharge my toothbrush every 2 weeks or so.",36
903,Wow!,5,I got this to replace my 3 year old oral b brush and oh my goodness what a difference! Really did make a difference. They do last awhile my old one still works fine but the new one definitely makes a difference!,42
904,Save your money on an expensive toothpaste and invest in this great power toothbrush,5,"This power toothbrush will make your teeth and month cleaner even if you use it with no toothpaste lol, this is how I tried it first time I got it after I used my regular toothbrush.
Highly recommend! You can see and feel the different from your first use.
Save your money on an expensive toothpaste and invest in this great product.",62
905,Too rough and powerful.,3,Feels like a jackhammer in my mouth...unfortunately too rough on my teeth and gums and it gave me an all day headache after using for 2 minutes for the first use. My teeth/mouth were really clean and impressive but the side effects not so enjoyable.,45
906,Gets the job done,5,"Great electric toothbrush. My first electric one and I’m impressed. I feel closer to a dentists clean after using compared to a manual. The charge has lasted about a week.
I’ve also noticed less plaque behind my bottom teeth since using. This was an area that was hard to get to with brushing and flossing.
The 30second buzzes are a nice reminder for proper timing.",65
907,So far I love using it,4,"I bought this toothbrush recently. So far I love using it, I was always hesitant to try an Eletric toothbrush I always thought that I brushed better manually but have noticed unmatched brushing cleanliness and enjoy how great my teeth feel after using this oral B brush. I also love the fact that I bought one and share it with my wife, we just switch the brush heads out which is super awesome. Eletric charge is great also holds for very long time. Comes with one brush the charger and oral b handle. Would definitely recommend this product as it is fairly priced.",103
908,"Oral-B Pro 1000 CrossAction Electric Toothbrush, Black",2,Very little use until it needs to be charged again. And what Bluetooth connectivity we are talking about?,18
909,Charge broke,1,Haven't even had this for 2 months and the charger will no longer charge. Dont understand how a charger can fail so fast leaving the toothbrush worthless,27
910,Great electric toothbrush at a great price,5,"I haven't had many electric toothbrushes, but this is by far the best I've had. Clean is great, the brush is easy to use and charge. Still works great after months of use. I I will mention the difference between levels of charge is very noticeable, but that can be pretty easily remedied by charging more often.",57
911,Great tooth brush but messy,3,I love the effectiveness of the toothbrush. My teeth are really clean. The problem is the timer doesn’t work and it is cumbersome in the mouth. For some reason my mouth won’t close around it and it becomes messy to use.,41
912,Great toothbrush,5,This toothbrush is extremely good at cleaning my teeth and making sure I maintain good dental health,17
913,Good item,4,"Like the actual device, did not like there is NO indicator as to which mode your in!…More expensive models might show that.",22
914,Nice toothbrush,5,"Easy to use, inexpensive and well built. Although it’s only a few day old, lol 😂. We’ll see.",18
915,New Toothbrush,5,Got this to replace one I have had for about 6 yrs that wouldn't hold a charge any longer. Love it so far. seems to be doing a good job. Guess I'll know for sure when I get my teeth cleaned next time.,43
916,It doesn't seem to be charging,1,"The directions say that the first charge of the battery may take up to 22 hours. It has now been over 36 hours
and the green light is still blinking, indicating that it is not yet fully charged. I got the product in record time,
and am looking forward to using it, but so far I can't use it at all. Anyone know anything about this???",66
917,Excellent Product,5,"This toothbrush cleans very well. Within 2 minutes or so I can thoroughly clean all my teeth and gums, and it leaves you feeling like you just left the dentist's office. The first few times I brushed with it my gums and teeth were a bit sore as this device does ""massage"" them quite a bit, but after that it has been smooth sailing. For the price point this is an absolute must buy.",74
918,Great tooth brush.,5,Love this tooth brush!! I have cracked teeth from a car accident a few years ago and though they’ve been repaired I felt like I could never get them clean. This does the job. Bought them for my whole family for Christmas. I also traveled with this toothbrush recently and was gone for three days. I didn’t bring my charger with me and it lasted the whole time (brushing twice a day for the full two minutes).,77
919,Good electric toothbrush,5,It's an electric toothbrush.... But it functions well. I bought it as a replacement for an Oral B that was at least 12 years old. The battery on the old one finally gave out. I have high hopes that the new one will last as long.,46
920,Personally I highly recommend it,5,"I love this product to the core of my soul seriously, I Purchased it for my husband and he ended up liking it so much because it cleaned very thoroughly I ended up buying myself one too because I really enjoy this product I highly recommend it",47
921,Very durable,5,"Bought this for my son. But I personally have been using this brush for about seven years. Would never go back. And on that note. I still have my original one I bought, the only thing I’ve had to do is change my heads. And I do that every six months at my biannual cleaning appointment.",56
922,"A solid product, but not perfect",3,"The toothbrush has functioned flawlessly since I bought it over 6 months ago.
My only complaint is that the brushheads bristles aren't suitable for getting between teeth. Longer or softer bristles might work better. Definitely continue to floss in conjunction with this brush.",43
923,Hubby likes it!,4,"I just brought one for the hubby and a new one for me. My hubby has never used a electric toothbrush, and I thought it was about time for him to try it. He was surprised how clean his teeth felt, so I'm happy. His is black, mine is white, so we can tell them apart! Got a winner here!!!",60
924,Stealth black,4,"As good as one would expect for Oral-B electric-powered toothbrushes. Its single speed is more than powerful and adequate. The narrower handle much easier to hold than many of their previous models. Finding the black rubber sheathed handle a bit too ""tacky"" and hoping it will not get stickier like in decomposing rubber sticky.",54
925,"Nice toothbrush, but pressure sensor doesn't work!",4,"It's a toothbrush. It does the job.
My main issue is the pressure sensor, or lack thereof. This is one feature that I was looking forward to, that simply doesn't exist in the product. Not sure why they market it as having that. Also, there is no bluetooth capabilities, so not sure why that's an option in the review.",59
926,"Good toothbrush, problem with charger.",3,"Actually, love the toothbrush (first electric one I've had and my teeth felt really clean) but the charge didn't last NEARLY as long as specified. I'm moving soon and already packed my charger more than a week ago, so of course the charge died after only 2 weeks (total use time). I followed the instructions carefully, but if you don't leave it on the charger all the time you may not be able to use it.",76
927,deep cleaning toothbrush,5,"dont like brushing teeth, but this lil baby does such a nice jpb. i thought the bristles were a little hard at first, then realized you only use gently over teeth. love it",33
928,Charging station was broken on 2 different units,2,"I had to have the first toothbrush replaced since the charging station didn't work. The toothbrush itself seemed functional if I charged it on my old charging station, but the new charging station just did nothing. The replacement unit's charging station worked briefly, but when I tried that night to use the toothbrush it was not charging and was completely unresponsive. Again, putting it on my old charging station worked perfectly.

As a toothbrush it's fine. As a product you can rely on, get something else.",86
929,Great product!,5,"Awesome little brush! Definitely helps keep my teeth cleaner and it’s got different settings as well. Battery holds for about a week, but the charging is easy and quick.",29
930,"No pressure sensors, false advertising.",2,"No pressure sensor. When I purchased this it said it came with a pressure sensor. The sensor is supposed to stop the brush if you press too hard, this doesn't happen or mine doesn't work. You can press it as hard as possible and no sensor goes off and the brush doesn't stop. I tested this on my palm and sure enough no sensor. Very disappointing.",66
931,Open hole at top gets toothpaste in it!,2,Toothbrush works ok - but the open hole by the toothbrush head gets toothpaste in it while you brush your teeth so the toothbrush stops periodically while brushing your teeth! I would probably return it but unfortunately I threw away the box! I wouldn’t recommend.,45
932,Decent in the beginning but discharges very quickly,2,"I have been using Oral B power brushes for the last 10+ years but this brush (I ordered 2 for me and my wife) has been terrible. It's much lower power than the regular brushes. But worse is that it starts discharging very quickly. I have been using this for 5 months and it now discharges within 1-2 uses!!
Did not expect such terrible quality from Oral B.
Do not recommend you waste your money on this",77
933,Muy bueno,5,"Me encanto el cepillo blanquea mucho los dientes y los mantiene limpios, incluso en el primer día.",17
934,Good Buy,5,"After loosing my Oral B 8000. I did not want to pay almost $200 again. I went with this way cheaper one and I do not regret it. Of course the Oral B 8000 is more powerful and has multiple functions, but this one is pretty good. My teeth feel super clean after every brush.",55
935,Teeth bright happy life,5,I used other electronic toothbrushes in the past and this one leaves my teeth feeling like I had a professional dental cleaning. The design of the brush head contributes to that. It's doesn't turn on as easily like my old one which eliminates splattering toothpaste every where. Just wish it came with a carrying case for travel.,57
936,Great Electric Tooth Brush,5,"There are a cornucopia of professional reviews about this toothbrush -- Plenty of techy gadgetiers love it. For me, there's two things that make me happy I got this brush. First, it can use the sensitive gum brush heads. Second, the two minute timer is divided into four 30 second mini-times, so I can do a quarter of my mouth at a time and know that I haven't short-changed anything.",70
937,Dirty and not working out of the box.,1,"Toothbrush came in an opened box and the entire product was covered in dust and hair, as if it were a returned product. The battery does not charge, and therefore I cannot test the brush head. I would put something positive but only thing it has going for it is looks.",51
938,Feels like a professional cleaning,5,"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this. I've been using electric toothbrushes for years, the cheaper, ten dollar type because I thought, ""how different are they, really?"" The answer is: VERY. This gives you a level of clean that feels like you've just been to the dentist. It's especially effective at preventing tartar buildup. I highly recommend.",61
939,Good Product,4,"I got this brush specially for the spinning head and I love it. It’s a little loud compared to previous electric brushes, but works better than the ones that just vibrate.",31
940,Did a great job cleaning my teeth,3,"Bought in December, it's now almost March and I have used it every day. Did a great job cleaning my teeth. Having said that, this is NOT recommended for people with sensative teeth! Over time the pain got worse till I stopped using it and switched back to a manual. Nice product, but if you have sensitive teeth I'd stay away.",61
941,Does a great job cleaning your teeth and mouth,5,I like that the profile of the brush and charger are minimal. I can leave it plugged in at the side of the sink and it takes very little room. Unlike the battery operated brushes there is never a loss of power. I'm quite happy with this.,47
942,Works just like one o' them rotary brushes,3,"I DON'T like the fact that the replacemtnt brushes are a price-screwing, though.",13
943,This product suck stop working after a month,1,"I love the design and the way it feel, but it stop working after a month I need my money back....",21
944,A great electric toothbrush,4,"This is a great electric toothbrush, BUT it takes a long time to recharge and the handle design is not very ergonomic.",22
945,So far so good. I had the exact version year ago but ...,5,So far so good. I had the exact version year ago but the battery stopped holding a charge. I got this one for Christmas. My first one had a blue handle that got dirty over time from thumb grease. This black one should stay cleaner. this toothbrush cleans as well as a trip to the dentist. Came with a brushhead to get you started.,64
946,Best Toothbrush Ever,5,Great price for vacation Friday m. My first Oscillating electric toothbrush. Love it. Never going back.,16
947,Nice color. Works well.,5,Love the black color. It works well. It’s powerful action is great.,12
948,takes a long time to charge,4,I like the oral b 1000. It does clean really well and is a step up from the model 500. My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to fully charge.,34
949,Not sure if they have the correct item,1,"I didn't but a bluetooth toothbrush with a timer. However, this toothbrush doesn't work well. It moves until you apply it to your teeth, it continues to make noise but stops moving oscillating/ moving",34
950,Reasonable price and very good toothbrush,4,Have not had much success with electric toothbrushes but this one is definitely a keeper. The best part is the round head; is easy to use unlike the regular size toothbrush head. My dentist recommended the Oral-B brushes so I'm anxious to see if my next checkup will be a super good one.,53
951,Great toothbrush,5,Great toothbrush I don’t use the timer to match I just keep brushing I feel I’m done,17
952,White teeth? You got it,5,These brushes are fantastic for the price. Just remember to keep them clean and replace the heads when needed. For >$40 it can't be beat.,25
953,problem with charger,3,"I received the toothbrush on March 8 and I charged only couple times...now the charger is I think broken, does not charge...I will have to order a new one...
I was very satisfied with it 'till last night....",38
954,Way too aggressive!,1,Might as well use a jack hammer on your teeth. Way too powerful and loud.,15
955,Cleans as expected,4,"Does not keep a charge, at least on the 3rd day needs to be charged.",15
956,Amazing Toothbrush - ignore the people complaining of the quadrant timer.,5,"Gets 'em good and clean. Leaves my chompers feeling as smooth as when they just went to the dentist.

People who complain about the quadrant timer that literally lasts 0.25 seconds need to calm down. We get it, you are a rebel. You don't like being told what to do - especially not by a machine. Hell will freeze over before you brush your teeth evenly. The world will know of your disdain for that back left molar.

If you don't want to change quadrants when the buzzer goes off nothing forces you to - you can also keep brushing long than 2 minutes. It is a big non issue.",110
957,"Good for the price, yes it’s loud",5,"I definitely feel like this toothbrush cleans my teeth super well, the timer function is nice, the other reviews saying it’s loud are no joke thing thing sounds like a jet engine. But it was affordable and it does the job, sometimes you gotta pick your battles.",47
958,No more receding gums,5,My dentist recommended I purchase an Oral-B electric toothbrush because of gum recession. She said the horizontal brushing - even with a soft toothbrush - is causing the recession and she doesn't want it to get worse. I didn't want to spend $100+ on an electric toothbrush so I read the reviews and decided on this model. It's been great. I wish I would have purchased it years ago. Highly recommend.,71
959,Great bang for the buck!,4,"Replace an older Oral-B that I'd had for maybe 10 years! It's solid, and the base is smaller and easier to position the toothbrush in. I like the cross-action head, too. Only thing is that a lot of toothpaste ""goo"" dribbles onto the handle while brushing, and it gets pretty slippery. Otherwise, probably the best bang-for-buck if you like the rotating brush heads.",63
960,Only lasted 9 months,1,I purchased two of these in January. Mine literally just died in the middle of brushing my teeth. Not a dead battery- just kapoot. I expected more than 9 months from a $40 toothbrush.,34
961,Tooth attack,1,"I don’t like this toothbrush at all this thing is not gentle , it’ll beat the crap out of your teeth! I thought it was more of a spin brush I was incorrect it has a back-and-forth action and this thing is aggressive it will be going back",48
962,"... even a tiny bit too much pressure which is annoying, and haven't figured out the timer yet but ...",4,"Sometimes turns off for a millisecond if you apply even a tiny bit too much pressure which is annoying, and haven't figured out the timer yet but overall good speed. The tooth paste leaks down into the head of the brush too which is kind of messy and I'm scared it's gonna rust eventually since there's a huge hole for water to get in where the head and body meet, but we'll see.",73
963,Terrible product,1,"It was fine at first, however it just broke after a month. I will never buy any oral b products in the future!",23
964,"my brief opinion: simple,does the job, battery holds up well too",5,"my brief opinion: simple, easy to use, does the job, battery holds up well too",15
965,Not worth it,3,"This toothbrush is ok, but I don’t see how it’s any better than the $39.00 version.
PLUS, they recommend that you just leave it on the charger. I didn’t buy an electric toothbrush to have to keep it plugged in on my sink all day!!?!?",45
966,Most good!,4,"Leaves your teeth feeling very clean. Obviously easy to use and I like that it just goes back on its stand for easy storage. I don’t think the timer works. It says each time it vibrates it’s 30 seconds. If this is true then it should vibrate four times and then shut off but it doesn’t. Also, need to wipe it down after using it or the base gets stuff on it. Would recommend though.",75
967,powerful brush head,5,"very good powerful electric motor on this toothbrush, the brush heads are also on the smaller side which i prefer because you can get all around your teeth to clean. wouldnt reccomend if you have sensitive teeth since the motor is surpringly powerful but if you do not its a great tooth brush",53
968,Great color,5,"I have used this style of toothbrush and it has made brushing my teeth much easier. I like the color of it, and it has a good grip. The price was right and it does the job.",37
969,Not what I wanted,1,The round head doesn’t clean deep like I would of thought. I got the round head because that’s what the dentist use. The hand handle is very loud and the battery does not last long. It takes a while for it to full charge.,44
970,Hubby loves this tooth brush,5,"My husband loves this tooth brush, he doesn't mine the sound of it. It does last without changing it for a good amount of time",25
971,Dentist clean!,5,I love this toothbrush! My teeth feel like I’ve just been to the dentist!,14
972,Me encanta siento una gran diferencia,5,Este producto es muy bueno se siente la limpieza en los dientes muy buena compra,15
973,Recommended by Dentist,5,I got this after my dentist told me I should stop using a regular toothbrush. I definitely do feel a difference in brushing my teeth. I’m glad my dentist recommended this brand as I can feel a difference when brushing my teeth. Never going back to a regular toothbrush.,49
974,Why all the good reviews,1,a few days shy of 1 yr old. This appears to not charge any more. No blue charging lights rotate.,20
975,Seems to be good quality and I hope it works well for me,4,"The toothbrush works well. I wish there would have been a base that held extra brushes as I bought extra brushes for my wife and I. The toothbrush works well. I bought it at my dentists recommendation to buy a spinning head toothbrush. There are so many brands, options and prices so I chose this one. Seems to be good quality and I hope it works well for me. I just started using it two days ago.",77
976,good product for the money,3,"the owners manual says it has a automatic shut off, it never worked for me. My dentist office recommended this brand as the brush head is small compared to other brands, this a great benifit for my mouth and teeth, a little noisy but that is okay for the price.",50
977,Toothbrush,5,I have read others reviews to each it own. I have nothing negative to say about this product. Strong action which is good for my teeth. I highly recommend this toothbrush.,31
978,It's amazing,5,"I've used it a few times and it is great! I've used a manual toothbrush my whole life and my teeth just feel so much more smooth and clean, it's amazing. Unless the appocolypse happens, never going back to a manual brush.",42
979,My teeth feel great after brushing,5,I purchased this Oral-B toothbrush just prior to my old one dying. May it rest in peace. It lasted for several years. I have received numerous positive exams from my dentist. My teeth feel great after brushing. I love the color and the fact that it's a bit more powerful than my last Oral-B. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and will continue to make this brand my go to brush in the future.,75
980,Disappointed,1,"Makes a horrible noise when in use, sounds like bearings going bad and it is brand new ☹️ The last Oral B lasted for years.",25
981,"Excellent product, far better than my previous Oral-B Brush",4,Love this product's functionality. Just wish I knew they had a WHITE version. (Maybe Amazon doesn't carry that one.) Would have much preferred the white one rather than the black one.,31
982,These work fine. I would give them 5 stars but it ...,4,"These work fine. I would give them 5 stars but it continues to be a mystery to me on why manufactures think the average consumer wants these glaring LED lights that could be used at the local airport as landing lights. Wow, when these need a charge, that LED flashes so bright, even with my bathroom door closed I can see the flashing between the bottom of the door and the floor. Other than that, these work great.",78
983,Amazing,5,I saw a difference after literally one use. I’ll never go back to a regular toothbrush again!,17
984,Like a street cleaner in your mouth,2,"I purchased this after using a Sonicare for over a decade. I decided to try Oral-B because it was an appealing price. I’m not a fan of this product. It is noisy, like a street cleaner in your mouth. It doesn’t hold a charge for long enough, less than 2 weeks. I do not recommend.",55
985,Charge does not last as long as older models,5,"I purchased this last November and tossed my old one(6 years at least). And within a week or so, had to charge it. Ok no biggie. Fast forward and im getting maybe 10 days tops out of a charge. I wish I had kept my old one -still love the brush itself but hate the charge.",56
986,What kept Me So Long?,5,"This tooth brush is almost heavenly...I honestly don't know what took me so long to try an electric/rechargeable. The clean that my teeth and mouth experience is almost indescribable. Also, I ordered an additional head for sensitive teeth..just an outstanding product and priced right. Kudos to Oral B for this one!",51
987,A VERY EXPENSIVE BASIC ELECTRIC BRUSH,3,"May be it's the brand name that makes it a best seller.
It really is a very expensive electric basic toothbrush with no choice of speed or programs .
I migrated to the Oral-B Pro 5000 for twice the price but with much more to offer.",46
988,cleans well,5,Nice item and is durable use this twice a day and have had no issues.,15
989,Not happy with the out come,1,"I purchased this item back in September of 2018 and it didn't work right from the start with the battery holding a charge for more then a hour. Most recently I would have to charge it for hours to get 2 minuets of operable use. Very poor quality that I don't understand as I have used this same product for years and they always lasted me 5 plus years. NOT THIS ONE.

Hopefully you'll make this experience right?

Kind regards,

Roger Livingston",82
990,Great Brush,4,"As a person who has used a manual brush all her life then switching to this, I am impressed. Great value, easy to use toothbrush. I love how much cleaner my mouth feels not only in the morning but throughout the day. My only complaint is that the rubber grip area on the brush can easily have lint stick to it, more noticeable with the black color. Remember to keep it in a drawer and not out on the counter for sanitary reasons!",83
991,Can never buy a manual tooth brush again!,5,"I’ve never owned a mechanical toothbrush before and I refuse to use anything else now! Using this almost feels like a cleaning at the dentist. I don’t know if the more expensive models clean any better, but I can truly say this is worth the price!",46
992,Loud but proud,5,Gets the job done in a very loud way,9
993,Awesome Clean!,5,"Love the new tooth brush. Switched from Phillips Sonicare and must say in just these few weeks this OralB outperforms the old Sonicare hands down. Had to get used to the timer functions on this one the old one would just stop after two minutes, the new system is actually better.",51
994,Fantastic Electric Toothbrush!!,5,This was my first electric toothbrush not including the $5 dollar ones you can buy at the drugstore with AA batteries. What a difference over the manual brush I've used for so long! My teeth are noticeably whiter with much less effort! My dentist has noticed the difference as well and I'm thankful that my cleaning come with far less...discomfort!,60
995,My Dentist Recommended,5,"Living in Pennsylvania, it's perfect for cleaning my one tooth.",10
996,Piece of Junk,1,"Barely functional, even when supposedly fully charged. Not sturdy at all. Says it has a timer mechanism but it doesn’t; needs to be turned off manually. Advertised as including 2 brush heads and comes with 1. Cheap piece of junk.",40
997,Works great,5,Works great. Definitely an upgrade over my previous toothbrush.,9
998,Stopped working after half year!,1, Stopped working Suddenly after bought for half year! I bought my sonicare brush for 2 years and it’s still working!,20
999,Clean clean teeth,5,Wow! Every time I brush my teeth it’s like I’ve just left the dentist office!,15
1000,Aggressive,3,"I've used powered toothbrushes before, do this isn't a new experience. This toothbrush seems well made and I like the signal it gives when it's time to move on to other regions of your teeth. The biggest issue I have is it seems very rough. The vibration is super aggressive compared to anything else I've used.",56
1001,Works as good as the more expensive ones,5,We got this model for my husband to take when he travels. We share the 3000 model just switch out the heads. He hated not having the toothbrush with him. This works and is smaller to travel with. No complaints even in comparison to the more expensive model. The paint has worn off a bit in the suitcase. Which isn't an issue at all.,64
1002,Very great,5,This toothbrush works very good. The has a timer and the does the deep cleaning.,15
1003,Great product,5,Love the timer function and teeth feel deep clean every night,11
1004,Would recommend,5,"These brushes last for years so when my old one started turning in by itself I ordered this one. It works well, I haven’t had a cavity in years and multiple people can use it since you can use multiple heads",41
1005,Good Product,3,"For the most part, same as my last Oral B. But this one it is difficult to tell when the 20 seconds are up and when to move to the next area.",32
1006,Seemed like a good buy as it was on sale,2,Seemed like a good buy as it was on sale. Maybe their higher end models are better but this is like putting a small jack hammer in your mouth. It has a circular brush that twists as well as moves in and out - and no speed control. Much to violent for my taste. My hygienist suggest I get something else as this may have contributed to pushing gums away from my teeth. I'll buy a different brand with a less rough approach.,83
1007,Good for tough spots normal sized toothbrushes can’t reach,5,"I am waiting for a tooth implant and couldn’t reach a spot now that needs brushing in the back. So I’m very happy with this! It gets the job done. Though it isn’t as powerful as some electronic toothbrushes, for the price, it is wonderful!",45
1008,Love it!,5,Love this toothbrush! Makes my teeth feel like I've just been to the dentist CLEAN.,15
1009,good,4,"I buy this product as a gift to a friend, and it is a good choice. My friend likes it so far. Very recommend electric toothbrush to people.",28
1010,This is my favorite toothbrush ever,5,At least my favorite electrical toothbrush. It's sort of fun brushing with this one. My teeth feel very clean afterwards. It's easy to hold and doesn't spray toothpaste everywhere if you take it out of your mouth for a half-second. Smart design.,42
1011,Battery life not good,3,Battery life is worse than my ten year old Sonic care. Wish I would’ve purchased something different for a gift. It works fine but having to recharge often is disappointing.,30
1012,Replacement for the Water Pic set I had,5,"Seems to do well cleaning, and will see when I see the Dentist for regular cleaning. One thing the Water Pic brush had over this is after 2 minutes (also had 30 sec pause intervals) the Water Pic shut off. The Oral-B has the 30 second pause but does not shut off after 2 minutes.",55
1013,Electric toothbrush heads,5,These heads seem to work better than any I have had before. They also seem to last longer too. Great product..,21
1014,Doesn't work,1,It doesn't work.,3
1015,Love this toothbrush!,5,"We previously owned a fancier version, but after years and years, it finally started slowing down. This one is nice because it is smaller and lighter. Really like this guy, and am looking forward to several more years of beautiful teeth.",41
1016,Perfect,5,"Recommended by my dentist, I absolutely love how well this cleans",11
1017,great!,5,"Bought this toothbrush after it was recommended by my dentist and let me tell you, it does wonders. With a regular toothbrush (no matter how great you brush) it does not make you feel as clean as you would like. The charge seems to last awhile before needing to give another quick charge.",53
1018,A little Ruff!,3,"It is very Hard on the Teeth! Not soft at all, very Stiff bristles.. And it always feels like it needs to be charged again....",25
1019,Better than Manual Brushing,5,"I bought this several years ago expecting to get at least 1 year's worth of everyday use. Well, I'm happy to say that it's still performing like a charm. I've used several Braun product in the past and its a brand I trust.",43
1020,Exceptionally Great Toothbrush,5,My Dr recommend an electrical tooth brush and this is the best by far. I’m happy I made the choice to stick with Oral B.,25
1021,Long overdue,5,My first electric toothbrush. Should have gotten one a long time ago. My teeth never felt cleaner except after a dentist appointment. The timer helps me not rush.,28
1022,Don’t expect it to last more than 2 years,2,It was working fine and great up until two years and just stopped working,14
1023,Noisy,2,The unit sent to me is very jittery and impossibly noisy.,11
1024,Great for my teens,5,"2 of us had these for over 1 year, so we got 2 more for other family members. Common charger bases so we can have 1 in each bathroom. The timer feature takes the guesswork out of brushing.",38
1025,"Functional, inexpensive, quality",5,"Previously I also had an oral b electric toothbrush that I enjoyed, but I had it so long it was getting moldy. Went with the same brand, this time with this spinning head one. So much better than my non spinning one. Teeth are cleaner, gums are happy. Charge lasts weeks it seems.",53
1026,deep cleaning,5,It gives you a deep cleaning,6
1027,Super clean,5,"Went to the dentist this month, they commented on how well I brush my teeth. I gave credit to this electric toothbrush. It's definitely keeping my teeth super clean....just don't forget to floss. :D",34
1028,Does NOT hold a charge,1,"Good toothbrush, but does NOT hold a charge, only last 2 minutes on a full charge! Terrible!!!!!",17
1029,Great for the price.,4,Great for the price. The toothbrush is kind of loud. It doesn't feel like it vibrates as much as my last one but I know it is giving my gums are a better cleaning. Battery lasted me during my travel for over a week before I charged it. Charges quick.,50
1030,A Must Have,5,"Love love LOVE this toothbrush! Works perfectly, and it feels like a professional dental cleaning every time. For some reason the bristles are bitter when brushing your tongue, even after 2 months. I’ve cleaned it with alcohol and thoroughly rinsed, no difference. Other than that it’s PERFECT!",47
1031,"Great product, highly recommend",5,"I was looking for a new electric toothbrush after mine went kaput, and I found this on Amazon. I read all of reviews and based my decision on those along with the reasonable price. It is excellent for gentle gums, much better than the SonicCare one I had before.",49
1032,I'll be using an oral b electric toothbrush forever.,4,I bought it because of sensitivity and I love it. It really feels like a better clean without brushing too hard so I haven't had any discomfort since I started using it. I just wish the battery had a fast charge. The battery does last long though.,47
1033,Fantastic clean feeling.,5,"This toothbrush is absolutely fabulous. It gives you that ""just left the dentist"" clean feel after only two minutes of brushing. I especially appreciate the vibrating timer to know when to move around your mouth. I originally got this as a gift for my husband, and he loved it so much, I bought one for myself, too.",57
1034,SO GOOD!!!!,5,"I absolutely love this toothbrush!!! After the first time I used it, my teeth have never felt cleaner!!! Except right after the dentist of course. I love that it vibrates every 30 seconds and then at the 2 minute mark. No more half-@$$ teeth brushing for me :). Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",56
1035,Really cleans teeth,5,Love it. Discovered replacement heads inexpensive,6
1036,Works great.,5,After about you uses it needs recharging. Plus every 30 seconds it's buzzing,13
1037,Dental office clean,5,Using this brush with the included cross hatch brush head. My teeth feel as clean as they ever have. Highly recommended.,21
1038,Solid Toothbrush,5,"Used to use an Oral-B and stopped for some dumb reason. It's a great toothbrush and I like the 30 sec buzz timer. Make sure to buy your replacements brushes at Costco or BJs though. They are expensive as heck. Worth it though, using a normal toothbrush just doesn't compare.",50
1039,Little brush packs some serious power,5,"This little brush packs a powerful whallop! It got my teeth squeaky clean, even in some of the hard to reach places! I love the timer feature that tells you to change quadrants. And I love the color! No more bright pinks or purples for me! But so far, so good. It's doing a great job at getting to all the little spots along the edges of my teeth and gums!",71
1040,Solid Electric Toothbrush that delivers the goods,5,Oral B has many electric toothbrushes from the cheap to expensive...this product is about mid-range and does a great job with the floss action heads...Love the timer function as well.,30
1041,Don't waste your money and time,1,"The battery will go down after 2 times brushing
Probably old product that is sitting back in the storage with years

Not good dont waste your money.",27
1042,Strong and loud vibration,1,"Strong and loud vibration, not a comfortable tooth cleaning.",9
1043,Defective,1,I bought as gifts for my parents. I got white for mom & black for dad so they could tell them apart. Unfortunately this was defective. It turned on fine but was unable to change modes/functions. I also purchased same toothbrush in white which worked perfectly. So I returned & will probably just get another white one.,57
1044,"So far, so good.",5,"Just got this toothbrush yesterday. Ordered it for my husband.This type of toothbrush was suggested by his dentist. He really likes it . He said that his teeth feels like he just came from the dentist (he's acting like a kid with a new toy, he keeps brushing his teeth).Thinking about ordering another brush head and using it myself.",59
1045,Don't leave home without it,5,This is one of the best one I've purchased. Love the fact that it stays charged for at least 3 weeks,21
1046,Works as advertised ... no problems.,5,"Purchased to use as a supplemental aid in addition to a using a regular toothbrush, and regular flossing.
Works well, and leaves your teeth feeling clean. Purchased one for my spouse, and he is happy with his as well.",39
1047,Painful,1,"Horribly uncomfortable, it's like brushing your teeth with rocks; my teeth actually bleed because it's so rough.",17
1048,It cleans well but I wish I bough the next model...,3,"It works well, but it’s hard to recognize the timer. if I could do it again I will buy the next model that has an option for different speeds when you brush, this one doesn’t have that option. As well the higher up model timer lights up every 30 seconds this one doesn’t have any indication other than the brush stoping for a second, which you could easily get confuse with the pressure sensor.",74
1049,Well worth the price.,4,"Very good toothbrush. Holds a charge (brushing twice a day for two minutes) for 8-10 days so far. It is a much better choice than the one my spouse bought, as hers does not have a low charge indicator light. She just gets surprised every week when it shuts off in the middle of brushing. Remember to read the specifications!

The only downside in my opinion is the color. Black was not the wisest of choices as it shows any and all remaining toothpaste. If you're a clean freak like me it will drive you a bit nuts.",98
1050,"Good, basic toothbrush",5,"This is a good, basic electric toothbrush and it seems to do a good job of cleaning my teeth. Noise is moderate.",22
1051,Awesome!,5,"What a great relief from manual tooth brushing. I never like electric tooth brushes, but this one leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean. It also has great features when you press to hard on your teeth and provides a enjoyable vibration to the gum line!",46
1052,Not bad,2,Not bad but it was breakdown after using one year,10
1053,A+++,5,This is the best toothbrush I’ve ever had. Great quality!,10
1054,Very good brush,5,Strong and cleans my teeth very good. Love the timer function.,11
1055,Dont buy,2,Made very cheaply and super basic. If you want a simple oral B the 3000 is the same price and much better. 8000 is cheaper than the 7000/7500 and works much better. Battery life is Best on the 8000 and worth every penny,43
1056,I love this brush,5,"This is my first electric tooth brush and I absolutely love it. It is easy to use, has timer, and works great.",22
1057,Much improved,5,I replaced an old Oral B. This one is miles ahead of my old one. Much faster and better cleaning.,20
1058,I just wanted to try other thing and I'm pretty satisfied. Yes,5,"I used to use philips sonic care tooth brush for many years prior to this. I just wanted to try other thing and I'm pretty satisfied. Yes, this one makes really cheap and loud sound. But the result is pretty good. Personally I think it's better than sonic care. And brush replacements are also cheaper which is huge plus for me.",61
1059,Best for regular oral care,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I was really happy after using it for several days . It’s easy to use and clean . If you want a good oral care , buy it . I’m going to buy it for the rest of my family members.
The packaging is good, it comes with instructions. Thanks amazon for great delivery service.",61
1060,Box packing very good.Fast delivery from Amazon.,5,"This toothbrush seems the most powerful.I had a old Oral b electric and this is way better.The build quality is German good.This and the 500 model are made in Germany.Durability is much better than anything I have used before.I,am tough on everything so I like everything except the stutter to move to a diffrent section in the mouth.Would prefer a blinking light for that feature.Happy, overall.",66
1061,Good brush but doesn't last. Not reliable in the long run. Second unit I've bought.,2,"Worked well for a while, but then the motor steadily declined. Lately the unit works sporadically, then not at all. When it does turn on, it is with such little power that it doesn't have any effect. Was hoping to have it be more reliable. I called the warranty hotline. It is still covered, but requires me to mail the unit and charger into them ($), and then wait 10-12 weeks to hear if I will be granted a refund in the form of a gift card. That leaves me without a toothbrush for months, so not helpful... This is my second toothbrush from them that has failed.",108
1062,This thing will rattle your brains loose,5,"This thing is like grabbing a tiger by the tail. Cleans great, timers a little goofy",16
1063,Amazing,5,This is my first electric toothbrush and boy can I understand why they are recommended. My teeth feel amazing! I debated on this one vs the sonicare but opted for this one for more individual tooth care and I am glad I did. The timer vibration will take some getting use to but it performs great.,56
1064,I bought one. It stopped working after 4 months,2,It worked fine when it worked. Then it stopped working. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Don't know if it was the charger or the battery. For the money it should last more than 4 months.,33
1065,Cleanest Brushing Ever,5,"I thought I brushed pretty thoroughly and still could feel plaque near the gums in the back. When I used Pro 1000 for the first couple of brushings I had a lot of blood in the rinse. Now after one week, no blood, no plague, cleanest my teeth have been short of the dental hygienist. Thanks, Oral-B. I love the timer which tells you to move to the next quadrant of my mouth.",73
1066,Buy this! It's awesome.,5,Best investment ever! Had such a problem getting my kids to brush their teeth and now they are happily doing so on their own!,24
1067,Great while is works,2,"Received this 2.5 months ago and thought it was great until the power button stopped working. Amazon will not replace the item since it’s outside of 30 days.

I will probably repurchase something similar at Target since the return policy is way better.",43
1068,Better Than Sonicare,5,"I have used a Sonicare for several years because I like how clean it gets my teeth. After the latest one died from old age, I decided to try something different. I have always thought the Sonicare brushes were a little too powerful for my teeth and gums so I made the switch. I love this toothbrush. It cleans as well as, or maybe even better than, my Sonicare and seems to do so gently. Then factor in the lower cost and you have my vote for best electric toothbrush.",90
1069,Full charge in 24 hours,5,"Brush as described works very well.
I would recommend this item.",11
1070,"Oral-B, B Stands for BEST in the business!",5,"Bought this as a suitable replacement for my previous electric toothbrush. (Similar Model) Which lasted several years prior to the rechargeable battery life expiring and no longer holds a charge. NO REGRETS! Or second thoughts! This was a ""No Brainer"" purchase.",41
1071,Love it from first use,5,"I have tried many powered toothbrushes and did not see the value/difference with ordinary ones. This one, and from the first use was a hit. Powerful motion, buzz that announces when to switch from one side of the year to the other, fully charged at arrival and easy to maintain and clean. If you are one the fence, don't be thus us a good value for money.",67
1072,Good Toothbrush,5,Does a good job....especially for the price.,7
1073,Wow I wish I was using this my whole life,5,This is a MAJOR IMPROVEMENT in the tooth brushing experience. I like that it briefly pauses every 30 seconds so you know to move on to a different section of your mouth. Keeps you brushing long enough but breaks it up a little so it doesn't feel like forever. My teeth feel super clean.,54
1074,Amazing value for the $$$,5,I love this toothbrush so much! It was recommended by my dentist. It cleans so well and I’m noticing a big difference!,22
1075,Exactly what we needed,5,This helps our teenage daughter brush properly. With the timed pulses to shift areas she does a much better job of brushing,22
1076,Great clean!,5,"It did make my gums bleed the very first time I used it. The instructions said that it would. I don't use this toothbrush every single day just because it's kind of strong. It does get all the plaque off and I love the timer feature. When I'm in a rush, I still use my manual toothbrush. But I love how the battery charge stays so long. I really like this toothbrush.",72
1077,Thorough Cleaning,5,"I feel like my teeth are being cleaned much more effectively than the cheaper store bought electronic toothbrush I would get in the past. I went away for a long weekend trip (4 days) without the charger, and it lasted at least that long - I haven't tested a longer time. Overall, I'm very satisfied!",55
1078,Cleaning teeth and mouth,4,It's a nice product however it's not quite as nice as my old brush. It does not seem to clean as well between teeth with pulse action. Flossing is definately a necessity. But for the money it does the job.,40
1079,Best Toothbrush Ever!,5,"Dentist quality clean, twice a day. Absolutely love this toothbrush I've had it less than a week, and I can already see the plaque reduction. Super impressed!",27
1080,Great price,5,Love these tooth brushes and got it for a great price,11
1081,Works great,5,"Me and wife both been using these for a few years. Can’t complain, they work great.",16
1082,So far everything is good only 1 thing....,4,"I can't say anything bad but it's still early. Does the job. I don't think it needs to stutter to inform you that it's time to move to the other side of your mouth. That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. This us the first electric toothbrush since I was a kid (and I'm old). Took me awhile getting use to it, but my teeth do feel clean after brushing. I would recommend.",76
1083,Fine quality dental maintenance and cleaning appliance.,5,"This is one fantastic toothbrush. Albeit simple, it gives you a dentist-quality clean. Brush heads are expensive, but that’s what you expect in a toothbrush of this caliber. It does the same function as the high-end models, at a affordable cost. Big thanks to Amazon for quick service and delivery as always!",52
1084,Nice.,5,"First time owning a electric toothbrush! Wish I would've tried them sooner. This is a great beginners brush. At some point I may upgrade to a brush that has more functions, but for now it works great.",37
1085,works great,5,"This works just fine, and the price was right.",9
1086,Squeaky clean,5,"Love it. Cleans teeth and gums well, and timer lets you know when you should move on to another area of mouth.",22
1087,Replaces extra cleaning at the dentist.,5,"I never thought to do before/after pictures. I smoke and my bottom front teeth show it. After 3 uses, stains are gone. Saved me an extra cleaning at the dentist. I generally go 3 or 4 times a year. That’s an excellent trade off!",44
1088,"Just Awful. Noisy, messy, garbage.",2,How does anyone like this toothbrush? It's noisy as hell and drips everywhere as you're using it. Terrible.,18
1089,Rotating action rocks,5,Love this Oral B. I’ve used sonic care also and find the rotating action of Oral B great for my deep cleaning and keeping my teeth shining & gums healthy.,30
1090,Quite possibly the perfect toothbrush!,5,"Quite possibly the perfect toothbrush! The charging base is nice and compact and doesn't take much counter space. The alerts every 30 seconds are brilliant, with a unique alert at 2 minutes. No more wondering about brushing times. The brushhead that came with it is actually perfect; I thought it was going to be too hard but not so... unless, possibly, if you have incredibly sensitive gums.",67
1091,I've always had great dental hygiene,5,"Incredible value for cost. I've always had great dental hygiene, but felt an immediate difference using this versus conventional brushes. My teeth felt cleaner, very easy to use, easy to charge. Can't say enough. I only paid $40 for this, so as long as it lasts me a year or two I'd be satisfied. A few months in and I have absolutely no complaints. highly recommended.",66
1092,Muy buen cepillo,4,"Es muy buen cepillo, se tarda 2 minutos mínimo",9
1093,My dr. recommended I get an electric toothbrush,5,"I was use a hand toothbrush and occasionally a cheapy battery operated one from CVS. I have a lot of tartar buildup and my doctor recommended I try a 'real' electric toothbrush. Wow, I love this one! You bet I notice a difference. And I am brush better and longer knowing it. I really like this one.",57
1094,Someone Put a Dentist in My Mouth,4,"Holy jeez. This is not your mom's electric toothbrush. This guy is *strong*; it's mindblowing the first time. Feels very clean. Only downsides are it doesn't seem to be timed like my old one and it ""clutches out"" more, i.e. pauses briefly in use, which is probably a good thing given the strength and not wanting to hurt anything.",59
1095,replacement,4,"Love the product. It replaces a five-year-old model that I dropped and it bounced into the commode. It still worked, but to use a unit that was toilet dropped. Not me. Anyone one a perfectly functional unit cheap? Lol",39
1096,Amazing! But loud...,4,"Love that I can find replacement heads easily! My last toothbrush was apparently discontinued and had to return 3 toothbrush heads until I decided to throw it away.

I love that this works well cleaning out my braces and around them AND it has a timer. This was only knocked down a star because of the horrific noise it makes. It's not a gentle ""pulsing"" noise, but a more of a mechanical loud one.",74
1097,This toothbrush is very very very loud. It's just not like others I have had. Do not recommend.,1,This toothbrush is very very very loud. It's just not like others I have had. Do not recommend. It brushes 'choppy'. I don't know how else to explain. It's just loud and not like other electric toothbrushes I have owned. Poor quality.,42
1098,Good choice,5,I'm glad to have gotten this. With so many choices and price ($100 or more for a electric tooth brush seems crazy) I decided on getting this model. It's basic and that is really all I felt was needed. Its a toothbrush so why would you need anything fancy? The timer is helpful to be conscious of the 2 minutes recommended by dentists to brush teeth. Initially the sound was a bit noisier than I expected . I've adjusted to it. I guess it was because it sounds louder in my head versus what it sounds like when it is not in my mouth. My dentist is happy too!,109
1099,Awesome tooth brush,5,"I LOVE this toothbrush! We also bought a Sonicare, and I much prefer the Oral-B. I'd say t's slightly noisier than the Sonicare, but otherwise a great toothbrush. I wish i would have bought one years ago.",37
1100,My husband loves it!!,5,"He liked the way it makes his teeth feel.
The Bluetooth connectivity he says is awesome.",16
1101,Love this toothbrush,5,How did I ever brush before having this? Definitely does a better job than regular brushing. Love this product and glad I didn’t spend the extra money on the Bluetooth nonsense,31
1102,Teens Like the Design of the Brush.,5,"My teen age boys love this tooth and use twice a day with no reminder. That says it all... If I can get them to use a brush without a reminder, it's a win for everyone. They like the sleekness of the handle and that is not noisy.",48
1103,WORKED FOR A SHORT TIME,3,DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. HAD TO HAVE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY,11
1104,Short charge duration.,3,This is supposed to hold a charge that lasts for 10 days. You’ll be lucky if it lasts 5 days. Otherwise it’s a great toothbrush. Any added features just make it less effective.,33
1105,Product,5,Love this toothbrush and my teeth feel so clean when done,11
1106,Battery lifespan is very short,3,I think this tooth brush is great but you can get others for less that work just as fine. I bought a less expensive one for my wife and hers has lasted a lot longer than mine. The battery on this is a joke. The rechargeable batterues lasted less then a year.,52
1107,good cleaning of the teeth,5,nice good working electric toothbrush. clean feeling after use. but after about 4 uses i charge it 22 hours... but i like it,23
1108,Battery life is bad,1,Used just once. Stays on for less than 10 seconds no matter how long I charge it. So disappointed. Was recommended. I don’t even know if it can be returned,30
1109,Great clean!,5,I am getting a great clean. It's a little bit noisy but I'm not brushing for 30 minutes.,18
1110,Works great!,5,"I have always had an Oral-B electric toothbrush. Long story short, some change of events in my life had me needing to repurchase a new one (not because there was anything wrong with the other one, it is still working as far as I know!) and this has been working great since my purchase in November 2019.",57
1111,Teeth feel incredibly clean; whiter after just one use!,5,"So far, I am extremely satisfied with this rechargeable toothbrush. For the price, you cannot get anything better. I have used several rechargeable toothbrushes, and this one has definitely cleaned the best, without making my gums hurt. I like the small base (smaller footprint than some) and the handle is very comfortable. After one use, I noticed my teeth looking whiter!",61
1112,Not the latest model,2,Product is not the latest model. This is reason for lower price. Bad description and incorrect ad for purchasing this item.,21
1113,I use it every night!,4,"I like it, but it can make a mess and needs to be wiped down daily. My teeth and gums seem to be doing better, and I use less toothpaste with it. If your teeth or gums are sensitive, I recommend using the sensitive gums brush head though, the regular ones are a little too hard and tough.",58
1114,and I've found It works so much better and easier than a normal one,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush, and I've found It works so much better and easier than a normal one, and has a nice design. I recommend it. The fact it's rechargeable is a big plus as well, since you don't have to buy and replace batteries. This is the ideal electric toothbrush, I think. No need for them to be fancier and more expensive than this.",67
1115,Exceeded expectations.,5,This replaces an earlier model that lived long but finally failed. The 1000 exceeds my expectations with improvements like the action and timer.,23
1116,Loudest tooth brush ever,3,Just got this product. Nice and compact. However its the noisiest toothbrush I have ever had. Perhaps because of the micro mechanism in the brush heads. My cordless Milwaukee drill motor is quieter than this thing is.,37
1117,I guess it gets the job done,3,Brutal. Messy. I guess it gets the job done. I miss my Sonicare,13
1118,Basic but brilliant,5,Simple but works like a dream and holds charge for 10 days,12
1119,Keep Cleaning,4,It’s keeping my teeth clean. Also the Bluetooth works well you follow the pattern when you are cleaning teeth!,19
1120,Great toothbrush!,5,Husband and I absolutely love these! He had neck surgery and I have shoulder problems and makes brushing so much easier and thorough!!!,23
1121,Really good toothbrush,5,"If you are looking for a simple power toothbrush this is it. Easy to use, on and off and that's it no fancy modes to deal with. Heads change easy. The timer is OK, I really don't pay attention to it, just use the brush, but some may like it.",50
1122,I will never buy a regular toothbrush,5,I was impressed that it vibrates and blinks red when u brush too hard.,14
1123,easy to use and effective for cleaning teeth...with one quirk...,4,these are easy to use and effective but have a tendency to work fine then temporarily shut off/ stop working then continue working again. apart from this they are fine.....,30
1124,Love It so far,5,"Bought this to replace an older unit that would not hold a charge anymore. Works well, as expected. Takes a little getting used to the timer feature. I like that it tells you when it needs to be charged. Old unit just stopped without any warning.",46
1125,"Vibration, loud",4,"I liked the toothbrush, maybe because it was my first time having an electric toothbrush.
And I am satisfied with deep cleaning. Plaque is invisible so I don't know if it's really removing or not but I feel so fresh after brushing my teeth with it.
What I DON'T like about the product is the sound.
It is very loud. Very very loud.
It vibrates so much and I feel so much vibration on my head and feels weird.
I dont know if other products do the same, sound the same.
Overall, I think this is a great product for only $50 quality.",103
1126,Friend and Foe!,4,"I find this a little unwieldy. It's long, and I suppose this is a requirement for the mechanics, but it results in difficulty depressing the start and stop button and bumping plastic against teeth on the turns!",37
1127,Dentist Clean Feeling!!,5,Love this brush! It gets to all of the hard to reach places. Has a timer so that you can time out the four quadrants of your mouth. I love it! Highly recommend. Even my dentist could tell the difference.,40
1128,"My timer do not work, I let it run more then 2 minutes and it did not stop . What the deal.",4,Are they really checked out before they are sold.,9
1129,Fast and clean,5,It works very well. This is replacing one I had for 5 years.,13
1130,Buy it!,5,Love this electric brush! Price for same brush through my dentist is $59. Really good value!,16
1131,convenient effective power brushing,5,"I like this model mostly because it has only a single speed. The multi-speed models are a minor nuisance to turn off. The extra pulsing motion of this model seems effective. All in all, it's a great cordless power brush.",40
1132,Nice,5,"I love this toothbrush, I was hoping out of so many I picked a good one and I did. I have good teeth and have no problems at the dentist and I hope this make it even better. My teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist when I use it. Battery last for a little over a week before it needs charging.",65
1133,Faulty product,1,"When I first got it everything was fine but right after the first charge it all went sour. I charge the toothbrush for a whole day and it will last 5 minutes brushing and it’ll die. This was the third product I have purchased and they have all been good, I believe I was just dealt with a faulty product.",60
1134,Really works,5,This cleans without having to apply pressure. Love the 30 second increments.,12
1135,The brush stopped working after 1.5 months,1,"Pathetic device. And now the return window is over, the brush stopped working altogether.
Oral Bozos.",16
1136,Works great,5,Don’t care for timer function…but very satisfied with the product,10
1137,"Works like a clock,",5,This replaces my 12 year old Braun Oral B Toothbrush. They last a long time. This one feels more powerful than the last one.,24
1138,Great!,5,I got this for my mom as a Christmas gift. She loves it! Says that it has worked great! She does leave it on the charger base so she could not speak on the battery length. I’m considering getting one for myself.,42
1139,Good,5,"You just need to clean it right after brushing

Does the work",12
1140,Love the timer function,5,Love how clean my teeth clean. This brush is so much better than others I have had in the past. Love the timer feature.,24
1141,"Very powerful; yet, gentle",5,"Powerful enough to give ""the gums"" a nice plaque reducing workout!!",11
1142,Works well,5,Gift for my daughter who wears post braces wires. She likes this electric toothbrush.,14
1143,So fresh and so clean clean,4,This is pretty nice for the price. My teeth feel really clean after using this much better than a tooth brush. The only problem I have is as I'm brushing my teeth at full power it kind of stops a few times and then starts backup. I don't know what that's about. But I do like the way it cleans my teeth.,62
1144,Under powered and load...,1,"This electronic toothbrush has only one power sitting and is far inferior to the next model up. It is a loud and clumsy piece. I ordered it thinking it would be the same as the 1500 that I bought for my wife recently.
I like the 1500 model and would give it five stars.
The 1000 is not a good unit. I had used my last electronic toothbrush from them for nearly 18 years. It was great, but it also cost a lot more.",84
1145,"Love the swap to electric, no blue tooth.",5,"Brush head is a little small compared to what I'm use to, however very easy to get around. Feels more agile than any other product I've used. Wish it held more tooth paste. Maybe I got the wrong size. Overall love the swap to electric. Battery life seems great. Waterproof of course.",52
1146,"I'm not getting any younger, so I decided to ...",5,"I'm not getting any younger, so I decided to step up my teethbrushing game. Coming from one of the old school manual brushes, this thing blew my mind (and plaque) away so much that I'd be too embarrassed to accurately express my amazement beyond what I have written here - it works really well!",54
1147,Works well,5,This is my first time using an electric toothbrush. It works really well at least my mouth clean and it doesn’t hurt my gums.,24
1148,ORAL B IS THE BEST!,5,"Replaced another power toothbrush that had died. This is WAYYYYYY BETTER!

Actually saved me a trip to dentist for cleaning....did that well.",22
1149,Works Good,5,"Works good, only a one speed though. Thought it was multi speed",12
1150,Feels like I go to the dentist every day!,5,"Great toothbrush that mimics the shape & size of the brushes that dentists use. It has 30 second notifications and a longer one at 2 minutes to help you make sure each quarter is evenly brushed. I’ve had it for about a week now and haven’t needed to recharge the batteries yet, which is also good.",56
1151,Good quality toothbrush for good price. Would recommend.,5,Bought this for my husband. It’s exactly what he was looking for. Good quality electric toothbrush for a good price.,20
1152,Great Product,5,"I bought this after trying the Sonic that both my wife and daughter use. The Sonic vibrated too much and tickled to much, they say you get use to it but I wasn't willing to go through that for several weeks. The oral B was perfect from day one as it spins instead of vibrating.",55
1153,This electric toothbrush gets the job done.,5,Very satisfied with this electric toothbrush. Immediate results. Great price.,10
1154,I buy top rated electric toothbrushes. This one is fabulous!,5,"My sonicare had broken and I decided to try this also highly rated toothbrush. It is piwerful, cleans my teeth extremely well, and I love the circling action.",28
1155,Good quality dental hygiene instrument.,4,"Sometimes the brush will stop rotating if I press just slightly too hard against my teeth, especially while trying to clean the back of the teeth. This is only a very slight annoyance and would probably happen with any battery powered toothbrush.",42
1156,A++,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush and I LOVE it. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.

I also want to point out the Oral B does not test their products on animals and their products do not contain animal by products. I emailed them specifically to verify.

Definitely recommend!",52
1157,Battery problem,2,"I guess there is some problems in the battery connection, with the movement it keep disconnecting and connecting, this is annoying",21
1158,I don’t know,5,Idk about connecting a toothbrush to Bluetooth seems silly to me but it works good all the packaging was in Spanish I think. The battery doesn’t seem to last as long as my other one but I still only have to charge it every 2 weeks.,46
1159,"Battery dead after 18 months, and price is 10 bucks more.",3,"Bought this brush on 12/28/18 for 39.94. Used once a day since. No issues, except battery has died and price has gone up to $49. (Rechargeable battery is NOT replaceable.) That's almost a dime/use. Seems a bit much.",38
1160,Good replacement,5,"Love it. The heads are expensive, but...",7
1161,Good value,4,"I had a really nice Braun toothbrush that died, and I couldn't bear to spend $100+ on another one, so I figured this would be a nice alternative. I like the timer, and the stand is easy to clean, but the brush head is a bit deeper than I would like it and it is much louder than my old toothbrush. Don't get this if you wake up earlier than other people in your house.",75
1162,Melts the plaque away,5,Just feels like the plaque gets blasted away. The toothbrush cleans the teeth really well and does not hurt the gums when you slip and brush over it. I have even bought the package bundle for my mom and dad because of how good this toothbrush is.,47
1163,It’s ight,5,"Still use it and I bought these like 2 years ago. Does the job. Didn’t know it had ‘Bluetooth,’ idk why it would. It’s an electric toothbrush, all it needs to do is clean your teeth so your breath don’t stank. Still, I’ll give it 5 stars because it’s still working.",51
1164,Good for lazy brushers,4,"Very satisfied with this product, does an excellent job cleaning. I'm not really a fan of the annoying timer function. Kinda motivates me to brush more too. 😬",28
1165,Sent Wrong Color - Great Toothbrush,5,"I purchased one of these for myself last winter and I love it. Just order one for my husband to replace another electric toothbrush he had. The toothbrush itself is great and he loves it, but I was VERY disappointed they sent white and not black like I ordered. We have too much going on for me to return it or I would have and he needs it now.",69
1166,Great value and performance.,5,"This bad boy changed my mouth game.
Switch to these spinners from a manual or up/down powered brush and learn what real fresh feels like. I literally can't stop brushing my teeth. And who'd want to?",36
1167,Works okay,2,Works okay the brushes are expensive to replace,8
1168,does a great job,5,THESE ARE AMAZING TOOTH BRUSHES,5
1169,Comfortable cleans easily,5,Brush teeth. Feels good and. Comfortable Bigbrush works well.Feels good lightweight,11
1170,not sure,4,"When the slightest bit of pressure is applied during use, the brush lags horribly
until it almost stops.",18
1171,Great quality,5,Cleans and brushes teeth perfect.,5
1172,Should've bought one sooner! 😬,5,"great product wish I bought one YEARS sooner.

Pros:

1. SHOWER:Can use it in the shower it's water safe.
2. PRICE/BARGAIN: It's not $100 like when these first came out
3. QUALITY: it's not cheaply made like those $5 crest units sold at supermarkets

Buy one for 39.99 you won't regret it.",52
1173,Worst electric toothbrush,1,"If you have a small mouth - DO NOT PURCHASE this product. Not only is this oversized round brush uncomfortable, the entire function of this electric toothbrush is subpar to Sonicare. I regret this purchase!",35
1174,It exceeded my expectations for an electric tooth brush.,5,I t works well because of the round brush gets into all areas of your mouth am very pleased with it is compact.,23
1175,Good clean feeling,4,Love how this cleans my teeth! Wish there were more settings on it though. Still a great toothbrush and decent price,21
1176,Garbage!,1,Second unit I have tried and they both have died within two weeks. Now they won’t give me my money back.,21
1177,"Awsome toothbrush, simple to use.",5,This is the first powered toothbrush I have ever used. I like the simplicity of it and the 30 second timer for each quadrant. Quick charging that will last throughout the week. The brush that comes with it is a little stiff for my liking so I have ordered a softer one. I am definitely a convert. I hope to see a difference at my next cleaning.,67
1178,Great toothbrush,5,My mouth appreciates this thorough cleaning machine.,7
1179,Amazing quality and good price,5,Love it. I feel like I've left the dentist every day. The battery lasts long too. I charge it on the weekends and it lasts easily all week. It's also very easy to change the heads. Best toothbrush I've ever had!,41
1180,Did not include brush head,1,"I was so excited to try my new toothbrush out today when I saw that they packaged had been delivered. When I opened the package, there was NOO brush head inside. The item detail says ""Included in pack: 1 Oral B Professional Handle, 1 CrossAction Brush head and 1 charger."" So I have contacted Amazon and the manufacturer with this issue and I will update accordingly. As of now, be wary that you might not get all parts as stated!!",80
1181,It does clean your teeth!,4,I love the brush but the base isn’t very stable and when I place the large handle on the mount it falls over often. I do not like that!,29
1182,Product revieew,5,I like the fact the brush lets you know when you have brushed 30 seconds at each quaddrant.,18
1183,Great electric toothbrush,5,I really like this toothbrush and it cleans teeth well. The timer feature does make it easy to brush longer.,20
1184,Too loud!!,1,I don’t like it. I work nights and I stopped brushing my teeth As much because it’s seriously so loud I wake up my housemates 😢😢😢,26
1185,Squeaky Clean,5,"This toothbrush is easy to use and it gets to the inside of my teeth so well. I start at the gums and work up or down, My mouth feels like I just returned from a ""teeth cleaning"" at the dentist.

Love it.",43
1186,Great buy!,5,This was my best freaking purchase of 2020! Changed my life! I love it! It makes me feel like I just left the dentist after a cleaning.,27
1187,Great cleaning,5,"I really love this toothbrush, it shuts off after 2 minutes and you get a good cleaning",17
1188,I can’t stop cleaning my teeth,5,This toothbrush is amazing. I originally ordered Quip bc of all the hype. I immediately returned it & came to purchase this Oral B. My teeth feel amazingly clean like I just left the dentist. It reaches far back to my molars which is difficult for most brushes. Buy this you won’t be disappointed.,54
1189,Works well,5,"I love this brush, my fav one. I got this brush for my friend, he loves it. I’ve been using the same brush for 8 years, it is still working well, just replace the head every 4 months. Batteries are very good.",42
1190,Very happy customer,5,First toothbrush I have found I can reach all ny teeth and have a clean feeling on all my teeth and whole mouth. I have a small mouth so best size for me.,33
1191,Tooth brush,5,I like the small head and the great feeling of clean.,11
1192,thoroughly cleans teeth.,4,Seems to thoroughly clean teeth but terribly noisy!,8
1193,Love it,5,This is my first electric toothbrush so I have no comparison but I truly love it. I do feel like my teeth are cleaner and I get to my back teeth much easier. I had an issue with brushing too hard and since this has the sensor that alerts you it has almost fixed my bad habit.,57
1194,Design allows build up to stay in brush head,1,I've always loved our Oral Bs but this one has a design flaw somewhere. It has holes along the upper part of the brush head piece that allows saliva and toothpaste to get in and mold (turns into black gunk). Super hard to rinse out and dry and then those black flakes end up in your mouth. Only had it a short while and don't feel very safe using it. :(,71
1195,It is shaped like an upside down smooth cone so hands continualy slips into mounth.,1,Do not buy this item. No designer ever tested it or they would have determined that a smooth upside cone is not a useable tooth brush. I am looking at ways to salvage this tooth brush and would welcome any ideas.,41
1196,Clunky,1,"This was very disappointing, it is heavy, clunky and hurt my teeth even when I barely touched my teeth with it. I went back to Philips Sonicare.",27
1197,Good so far,5,Powerful. I always keep it charging. Deep cleans. Works great.,10
1198,Loud but works,4,"I had been using the same brand but the ones that were battery operated and more replaceable. I liked the smaller head on this, so I thought I’d try it. This toothbrush sounds like I’m landing a jet inside my mouth. It’s also a little more violent than I expected (not great if you have much of a gag reflex) - but it gets the job done.",67
1199,Does a great job and easy to use,5,"I like this electric toothbrush because the rotating brush does a great job. My teeth really feel clean. It’s easy to use and charge. I’ve used it for many months, and I’m very satisfied with it. I bought one for my husband too. He likes it too.",47
1200,Very good product,4,No idea how to work some of the features but it does give a very very thorough cleaning. That’s what my review is based on. All of those extra features are icing on the cake.,35
1201,Extra clean teeth!,5,"I've always loved Oral-B toothbrushes for the way they clean and can fit into the back of my mouth, but this one with the cross-action brush head makes my mouth feel even cleaner than the model I had before, which after about 15 years of use finally wouldn't hold a charge anymore. These toothbrushes are excellent quality.",57
1202,Good Deal,4,quality product and decent price!,5
1203,Almost perfect,4,Lot of power. Grip is good BUT the on off switch is difficult to work,15
1204,but the small head allows some nice tooth maneuvering ability,4,"SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND RIGHT ROUND.

Hard to tell if you're using too much pressure, no real indicator.
but the small head allows some nice tooth maneuvering ability.

Nice small portable charging stand. Brush head has been lasting me a couple months already, good quality.",45
1205,Too harsh - like a jack-hammer on my teeth.,2,"This toothbrush was much to ""rough"" for me. As I was brushing my teeth my whole face felt vibrations, which was uncomfortable. It even hurt somewhat - I don't know how anyone could like this toothbrush. It's like a jack-hammer on my teeth. Maybe mine is defective?",47
1206,Dental care,4,Works well but rotates like a heavy duty item,9
1207,Great toothbursh,5,Easy to use. does a great job of cleaning teeth,10
1208,Terrific Toothbrush,5,This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling so much cleaner than the normal brush. The timer function is super handy,19
1209,Teeth feel very clean.,5,This is the first electric toothbrush I have purchased. It’s easy to use and my teeth feel great. I do wish I had bought one with a place to store two toothbrushes.,32
1210,Great toothbrush,5,It's a really good toothbrush i like the round brush head...oral B Some Gave bad reviews I think it's a great toothbrush...,22
1211,Awesome clean,5,My dental hygenist reccomended this tooth brush and wow my teeth has never been cleaner.,15
1212,BATTERY LIFE IS NO GOOD,1,The battery life is terrible. I brush my teeth twice a day and by the second day after I fully charge it the battery is already dead (so 3 uses). I bought this toothbrush back in December (currently April) and I am already going to have to get a new toothbrush soon because I cannot take it with me on trips if I do not have the charger with me.,70
1213,Broken after one charge cycle,1,"After charging it the second time it has become completely unresponsive even though the charge light says it's fully charged. They are still using Ni-Mh batteries, c'mon Oral-B I thought you were a reputable company it's not 1995 anymore, use a contemporary battery technology! Hint, Li-ion yes jeez.",48
1214,Basically disposable,2,Had it a month before it started stopping when brushing for no reason. It will continue to work after I mess with it. I bought a couple of these and most had this problem,34
1215,Vibration too harsh,3,Works well but the vibration is very harsh/rough. It honestly shakes my vision when brushing my teeth. It feels like a cammed LS V8 in my mouth whereas my old toothbrush felt like a stock rotary.,36
1216,Soooo loud- a jackhammer in your mouth,1,"I had an oral-b vitality for a few years, replaced that with a Phillips sonicare that died after just 2 years, & found this as a replacement. But this pro 1000 is the loudest brush I’ve ever used- Like a jackhammer in my mouth. I’ll be looking for a new replacement. It’s terrible.",53
1217,Great toothbrush,5,"I’ve been using this tooth brush for 2 months now. The battery power has lasted and has been fine. The head that it came with fit and works perfectly.
Edited to add: I’ve had this toothbrush for 2 yrs now. It has gotten very loud and can tell the battery I starting to die.",54
1218,Feels like a thorough cleaning!,5,"I replaced a rechargeable tooth brush with this brand after seeing all the ads for the advantages of this one. and I must admit, this does leave my teeth feeling extremely well scrubbed. I had no gum bleeding. I also got a set of the Floss brushes and they work well, too. The unit is slender and takes up very little real estate on the bathroom counter. Extremely happy.",69
1219,Disappointed.,4,I did not get what I expected. It does NOT have 3 speeds. What I received is a single speed rechargable toothbrush with a 2 minute timer. The write up is misleading.,32
1220,Good,5,"Purchased after tearing my gums from brushing too hard (apparently, it's impossible to make this kind of mistake with an electric toothbrush). In any case, my teeth are cleaner with an electric toothbrush than they have been with a manual.",40
1221,Meh,1,Stopped working after one use. Charger didn’t work. Battery was faulty. Possibly a bad batch.,15
1222,Great product for the money,5,Really good toothbrush like that it goes in a circular motion my DDS recommended it it does a great job,20
1223,Give it Some Time,5,"When I first tried this toothbrush it made my gums bleed a little bit. However, I gave my gums a couple of days to heal and next time I used it my gums were used to the scrubbing and my teeth felt much better than after scrubbing with a conventional toothbrush. The pulsing after 30 seconds is also a nice feature to tell how long you've been brushing.",68
1224,"Great toothbrush, gives me a dentist cleaning feel",5,"Great toothbrush, gives me a dentist cleaning feel. My gum health has definitely improved since using this tooth brush. The timed vibrations vibrate every 30 seconds to signal how long to clean each quadrant of the mouth followed by 3 vibrations after 2 minutes, this is really helpful to make sure I'm brushing long enough.",55
1225,Love it!,5,Use it every day and my teeth feel much cleaner then my old standard one.,15
1226,Works very well and makes my mouth feel so clean ...,4,"Works very well and makes my mouth feel so clean. I brush twice a day for 4-6 minutes and the charge lasts about 7+ days. The only problem is, about 2-3 times during brushing, it appears to slow down and almost want to stop. As if it’s stopping to rotate the opposite way of turn. And that may be what it’s doing.",62
1227,I couldn't have asked for more!,4,The electric toothbrush does last for quite a long time without charge. Make sure to rinse this as toothpaste can end up stuck on it. You can adjust the speeds at which you brush your teeth. I only wish be less awkward to hold. I am still getting used to it.,51
1228,Stopped working after three months,1,"I had an oral B electric toothbrush for years till it finally stopped charging. I bought this oral B and after 3 months it stopped working. As if the charge isn’t functioning. Also when the toothbrush did work, I found the cleaning to be too forceful which aggravated my gums. So all in all a lemon",56
1229,Powerful! So fresh and so clean clean,5,I honestly didnt know it had blue tooth connectivity or a timer function so I cant speak to that.. but it really really cleans your teeth! I will never go back to the cheaper 5 dollar electric brush ever again!,40
1230,"Good, but didn't meet my expection",4,"It's my first time to try oral-B. Previous I used Philip electric toothbrush. The 2-minute timer is good. But it's too noisy. I bought one for my husband. He doesn't like the sound, too. I don't think I will but that again. I would like to try some better one.",50
1231,My Mouth and Gums like this toothbrush,5,The thing I like the best about this toothbrush is something I didn't think was important--the timer. It really helps me stay disciplined on brushing for two whole minutes.,29
1232,"This is my second one, very happy with this model.",5,"This was a replacement for a similar model that was over 5 years old. Design has not changed and operation is identical to older model. The initial charge takes a long time, subsequent charges are fairly quick. It would probably go all week with one charge. Best feature is the vibration every 30 seconds and double vibration at 2 minutes.",60
1233,Nice simple electric toothbrush that cleans well.,5,"A really nice brush at a good price. It cleans much better than a manual. No bluetooth or timer, just a nice brush tha cleans well.",26
1234,long lasting charge,5,"I really like how long lasting the charge is with these. We are able to go away for a week without having to bring the charger. Also, it is nice you can buy new heads without buying the whole thing again. Also, nice in comes in black and white so we know whose is whose.",55
1235,Mileage Varies,3,Worked well for a year and then wouldn’t turn on. My wife’s lasted longer than mine. You’re mileage varies with each one.,22
1236,Good for sensitive gums and hard to reach places,5,"I had been having issues with my handheld toothbrush making my gums bleed. I have very sensitive gums and a weird angle on my lower row of teeth that make effective cleaning difficult. Not only is this product gentle on my gums, it cleans hard to reach and problem areas VERY well. I've only had it for a couple of days but I can see and feel a noticeable difference with my dental health. Very happy with this buy",79
1237,Very durable,5,Love it use it everyday have had no problems with it. The last one I bought lasted for years,19
1238,Do they sing my praises for having such excellent hygiene? This one,3,"Here is how I rate a rechargeable toothbrush - does the dental hygienist have more work or less work to do when they clean my teeth? Do they sing my praises for having such excellent hygiene? This one, not so much. I was so looking forward to my visit after purchasing this and using it for several months, but was very disappointed.",62
1239,Second one to break in less than 6 months,1,"For what you pay you'd expect to get more than 6 month's use out of this toothbrush! And what's worse, this is the second one out of the last two I've purchased to go belly-up! What the heck? Braun is making piles of junk. Do not purchase unless you've got money to burn.",53
1240,Feels like i just came from the dentist.,5,"I used to have a electric toothbrush, but my dentist said I brushed too hard with it and I was damaging my gums, or something, so I stopped using it and went back to a manual toothbrush.

Lately, I have been thinking about going back to an electric and I bought this and I can feel the difference and it tells me when I'm brushing too hard. Great toothbrush.",69
1241,Quality,5,Very good prices,3
1242,I can brush my heels with this item,1,"This brush is too hard and has one speed. I can brush my heels with this only. Got a headache after use. The vibration is too hard and speed too fast that my toothpaste was all over the walls. I wanted to return this but I can’t, so I decided to write a review.",54
1243,One of best brush I bought in my life,5,This is the best brush that I ever bought the brushes my teeth very well and I love how strong it is on how fast it goes,27
1244,Better than the battery.,5,"Great toothbrush, but battery life could be better. With regular use, battery lasts about a week without a charge. Recommended if you don't mind clearing a spot on your bathroom counter top so it can sit on the charger between uses.",41
1245,Excellent,5,Great toothbrush very happy with.,5
1246,Sooo LOUD!!!,1,Worst Toothbrush I’ve ever bought. LOUD!!! Timer didn’t work. Awful. DO NOT BUY.,13
1247,Second time having this brush & second time having a defect,1,I received this product less than a month ago and it stopped working. I placed It to charge and it has been charging for over 2 days and when i try To use the tooth brush it does not want to start. I would Assume after 2 days of charging it would be fully charged. According to the instructions it takes about 22 hours to charge. I’m very disappointed. You exchanged my toothbrush & its been less then a year having the replacement toothbrush and the same problem occurred. I would like a new tooth brush. This brush has a 2 year warranty. There’s obviously a manufacturer problem with this brush since this situation keeps happening.,116
1248,FANTASTIC!!!,5,FANTASTIC!!! I'm thoroughly satisfied with this toothbrush. It's at the bottom of the list of fancy electric brushes but it's good enough for me. It tells you every 30 seconds to switch sides while brushing and will also notify at the 2 minute mark.,44
1249,Great for the value.,4,"Noticed a difference within a week! Love it. Only con is it is noisy and to charge it, it takes forever. My friend asked why did you get the oral b verses the soniccare I told him when you get your teeth cleaned what type does the hygienist use?",49
1250,Okay for the price,4,"Price was okay for what you get, beats a manual brush hands down…. Only dislike is it doesn’t have two speeds like my other Oral B
and doesn’t come with a case like my other one did.",37
1251,Easy to electric toothbrush,5,Family member likes the brush.,5
1252,Wish I had gotten one sooner!,5,"I've always used battery powered toothbrushes, this is my first experience with an electric, rechargeable model. I absolutely love it, I wish I had gotten one years ago! It takes brushing my teeth to an all new level, I look forward to going to the dentist and seeing the difference in the amount of plaque on my teeth after using this!",61
1253,Does the job well at a reasonable price.,5,This has no bells or whistles but gets the job done. This is my 2nd one. My first one lasted about 7 years!,23
1254,Disappointed,1,"Wanted to replace my aging Philips Sonicare and thought I might try Oral B. Very disappointed. The sound, vibration, and function were like driving a Model T (vs a sports car). Also, the brush shaft dia. is much too large. Going to order a Philips Sonicare again.",47
1255,Died after 7-months,1,Product was great for 7 months. Then it died. I place it on the charger. Looks like its charging. I take it off when it appears done. I try to use it and it won't turn on. Wasted money.,39
1256,Nice product,5,"Easy to operate, great cleaning",5
1257,Poor quality,1,I depended on the oral b reputation. Bad move. It will not charge up. Am currently using it as a manual toothbrush.,22
1258,Best toothbrush ever!,5,Best tooth brush ever! I bought this toothbrush 2 weeks ago. I can already notice a difference. Fly teeth are whiter and have less plaque. My mouth feels fresh and looklppls fantastic! I would recommend this brush to everyone. I love the timer on it as well. It reminds me to switch sides. Everyone needs this brush!,57
1259,Great upgrade,5,"Bought this as a replacement for an old Oral-B toothbrush that kicked the bucket. It's great; it seems to vibrate/oscillate at a higher speed and really does a good job. The charger is sleeker than the old one and the toothbrush has a battery light on it. It's a little taller than the last one, but the heads fit the same.",61
1260,Just an ok product,3,"This thing is so loud. OMG U can feel the noise in your brain when brush... The pressure sensor doesn't seem working. I tried to put some pretty heavy pressure on when brushing my teeth just to test it out, it did not stop. The pain will stop u when u brush too hard b4 the sensor stops it. It feels like a good quality stuff in hand though.",69
1261,OK. Not perfect,5,"Great cleaning, be selective in which heads you buy. I could do without the timer function and wish it has a lithium battery",23
1262,Product Information Incorrect,3,"This model does not have a pressure sensor. For those with sensitive teeth, this is important to know. Otherwise, a fine toothbrush.",22
1263,Nice toothbrush,5,"Great product, love the toothbrush. Will buy more for family members who have older ones.",15
1264,Awesome!,5,My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I love it.,9
1265,Good clean...too good maybe?,4,I'm used to the other style so this rotating style takes some getting used to. The surface of my teeth was noticeably whiter and more glossy after the first use. It's like a dentist clean. I'm concerned about it wearing away my enamel. It's hard to tell if it's cleaning between teeth as well as the other non rotating styles out there,62
1266,A good brush,5,"Bought to replace an old/outdated electric toothbrush. It's working well, and seems to have a long life between charges. My hygienist recommended use.",23
1267,Works very well - just the way it should,5,"I replaced my old toothbrush which I used for many years. This one is stronger,",15
1268,"Terrible battery life, lasts two or three uses before requiring a charge",1,"If you enjoy your toothbrush running out of battery every other use, this is the one for you. With an amazing battery life of what seems to be no more than 10 minutes, have a wonderful time constantly taking your brush over to the charger to ensure it doesn’t die on you when you need it.",56
1269,So loud omg,3,I’m an opera singer. This tooth brush is LOUD. It was nice to hum different songs with. Luckily I upgraded to a Waterpik brush. I do keep this on hand for traveling though.,33
1270,Charging issue,1,Total waste of money. It takes over 24 hours to fully charge the battery. then the battery lasts only for 24 to 36 hours!!! So you need to constantly charge the damn thing :(,34
1271,Nice product,5,Took a few days to get use to an electric toothbrush. The brush head was way too harsh on my gums so I ended up buying the ones for sensitive gums. Love it overall,34
1272,Great simplistic toothbrush I've been wanting.,5,"I've owned several electric toothbrushes and plenty of none electric toothbrushes. This one is by far the best choice.

I'll compare this model to a more expensive OralB that I've had in the past. That one had multiple heads and a container for them, a display with a clock, multiple functions for brushing, etc. This one is a true no nonsense brush. It has all the positive qualities like the durability and functions of an expensive OralB but without the price tag. It just has a charging base, the brush itself, and the brush head. That's all you need anyway. It does a great job at getting in the tough to reach places and doing its job.

The brush seems to be made out of durable plastics, so is the charging station. The battery is indicated by a LED on the front but it seems to take about a week of brushing to drain that battery. I love not having to worry about charging it constantly like my old Oral Bs

Pros: Cheap, Effective, Simplistic, Plug in and go, Durable, long-lasting battery, switchable heads

Cons: None

Fantastic brush for the family member or college student. Oh and switch your heads every 3 weeks! That's how you keep it clean!",209
1273,I hate when I don't have this with me because brushing ...,5,"I hate when I don't have this with me because brushing my teeth is never the same with a regular brush. I don't have good teeth, but after some dental work over the past couple years, this last month was the first time I had no cavities or issues or really any plaque buildup. I credit the use of this and a waterpik",63
1274,Excellent for kids!,5,Cleans better than a manual toothbrush,6
1275,Quality product,5,Easy to use and highly recommended,6
1276,"perfect, highly recommended",5,"perfect, I had a fancy wireless one that was great and it lasted several years. I love the more simplistic model. It vibrates in your hand to let you know when 30 seconds is up, then vibrates twice when 2 minutes is up. It even lets you know if you're pressing too hard on your gums. I would HIGHLY recommend this model. The black looks pretty cool too.",68
1277,Powerful,5,I love how powerful this toothbrush is I felt a difference after one uses.,14
1278,Teeth feel cleaner than ever,5,"Timer function is a little confusion and seems unnecessary, but my teeth have never felt cleaner.",16
1279,Misleading advertisement,3,"Only had it for about a week but The product cleans your teeth very well. Squeaky clean. But the advertisement is a bit misleading.
It does not have a pressure sensor or a 2 minute timer. That was partially the reason I purchased it and quite disappointed when I realized that it does not have neither.",56
1280,Cleans well...,5,"Really cleans teeth well, but the brush is so small I have to keep adding more toothpaste as I brush. Timer is useless.",23
1281,Excellent basic electric toothbrush,5,I had used those battery powered grocery store toothbrushes for a while and they were ok. I don't like sonic care brushes as they tickle/bother my gums too much. This is the perfect middle ground. I really like how it times 30 seconds for each section you brush.,48
1282,amazing for teeth and gums.,5,Bought this for our grandson who is autistic and hates brushing his teeth. He has sensitivity issues and has had many many cavities!! Hopefully this will help him keep from loosing his teeth. He has major gum problems and many cavities.,41
1283,Great Electric Tooth Brush,5,"Works extremely well and is quite affordable. My hygienist recommended getting an inexpensive electric such as a sonicare or oral B. I chose this because of the reviews, it had a round brush head, can use numerous different style brush heads, and I have used oral B manual brushes for years with good results.",54
1284,Work very well great product,5,I like it works very well very efficient great product and it arrive at a great time,17
1285,"Works great, but noisy.",4,"My teeth feel super clean after using it. I’d say the only downside is how loud it is. Very noisy, but very efficient.",23
1286,BEST EVER USED!!!,5,Wow!! Have had & tossed out Super Expensive Kinds Over the Years That did Nothing or caused Bleeding or sore gums. THIS IS AMAZING!!! I drink tea now & This gets Excellent Cleaning Teeth And Gums. You feel cleaner & look in smile and healthier for my teeth and gums. I’ve already recommended to Others!!,55
1287,I noticed a difference immediately!,5,My dental hygienist shared that the electronic tooth brushes with the circular motion do a better job than regular toothbrushes. She noticed a difference in the appearance of my gums after using my Oral-B. I LOVE it and will never go back to anything else! I feel like I have great gum and tooth care with my Oral-B,58
1288,Love it!!!,5,"I buy one for me and one for my husband, it is amazing how you feel the cleanse",18
1289,Died after 8 weeks,1,Died after 8 weeks. Useless piece of garbage. Save your money.,11
1290,Works great!,5,Well worth the price to pay for this toothbrush. I needed to find something that would get rid of plaque and this does the job. 100 times better than using a regular toothbrush and I feel much cleaner. Ive had it for a few months now and has no problems even when I switch out the toothbrush heads. I pair this with a water pik and I have healthy gums now!,71
1291,Has lasted many years,5,"I bought this in 2017 and it hasn't failed me yet. I don't know if the newer versions are better manufactured, but I'm very pleased that this has lasted me more than 3 years.",34
1292,Great toothbrush,5,Works great charges quick and was of use,8
1293,Can't beat the quality for this price!,5,Bought these for myself and my husband and have been very happy with them. We pondered buying the newer versions but decided to go with the more economically priced version (based on the high rating from Google). Very happy we did. This model does a great job cleaning. The more expensive models have different features but they aren't worth the extra cost in my opinion.,65
1294,Great color,3,"Does not work with Bluetooth, does not quit if you push too hard, you have to time your own brushing",20
1295,Didn’t know I was purchasing a jackhammer,1,"Hated this jackhammer of a toothbrush, I ended up returning it. It was so loud and aggressive I was shocked. The weirdest thing was when I tried to look it up on the oral b website it was non existent. So back to amazon it went and I bought another sonic.",51
1296,Husband Loves It,5,My husband has always had an Oral B Toothbrush. So when his died we had to get another one. He says he loves it.,24
1297,Love it,5,It's great. Have had it for about 4 months now and it works great. Cleans nicely.,16
1298,What Bluetooth connectivity?,3,"I didn’t know that stuttering was a timer function. Feels like it’s going to quit.

Works ok, but I really have to brush for a long time before my teeth gel really clean.",33
1299,My only regret is not ordering this many years ago.,5,"My only regret is not ordering this many years ago. It cleans well, it is simple with no unnecessary features, and because of that it is cheap. The first time I used it it really felt like I had just come from the dentist after a cleaning appointment. I have been using it for several months now and it still works as expected.",63
1300,I donot know.,5,It was a christmas gift.,5
1301,My son likes brushing his teeth,4,It helps him clean his teeth better!,7
1302,"Great item, nice price.",5,Works great and easy to use,6
1303,Love It,5,The wife LOVES this brush,5
1304,No more hassles at brushing time,5,"No more hassles at brushing time. this has made a huge difference for my daughter when it comes to brushing her teeth. SHe thinks its fun to use, and it does a great job cleaning her teeth with minimal effort on her part. Hopefully better check ups will follow",49
1305,Like going to the dentist twice a day!,5,Well worth it! Super clean teeth & gums & tongue! Very powerful!,12
1306,so loud,1,I can't begin to describe how loud and aggressive this brush is. Unbelievable. Ridiculous. I wish I could return.,19
1307,fantastic brush!,5,"Wow, this one is a keeper. I definitely prefer the round heads and plan to buy another one for a family member. My dental hygienist is impressed with my lack of plaque or tartar. Use this brush with a waterpik and some charcoal toothpaste and say good bye to uncomfortable dental cleanings!",52
1308,Works very well,4,"I really like this toothbrush. It doesn’t take up much space, it holds its charge, deep cleans, and I can find several types of toothbrush heads that fit it.",29
1309,oral B electric toothbrush,3,The timer doesn't seem to be functioning; don't feel this toothbrush works as well cleaning as my older Sonic.,19
1310,Good toothbrush,5,Good electric toothbrush. Battery lasts a while. Easy to charge. Easy to replace head. Does a good job cleaning. Timing function helpful.,22
1311,My first electric toothbrush,5,I’m new to electric toothbrushes but my dental hygienist recommended I start using one and I’m glad she did. My teeth felt really clean after using this toothbrush. I have crowding so some areas are hard to reach but this toothbrush reached everything. Ok highly recommend.,46
1312,great product,5,I have owned this for a few months now and it's great. My teeth get super clean and it's easy to use/charge. Charge seems to last me about a week and it charges quickly. I will probably buy another for my son as he just has a battery operated one right now.,52
1313,Deep clean / Expensive replacement heads,4,"Bought this for my husband. He really likes it in comparison to a normal ""manual"" toothbrush. Charges on a charging stand, and he has to do it about once a week or so. Not sure about long-term cost-effectiveness due to the price of the replacement heads, but I suppose you pay extra for a deeper clean!",56
1314,Excellent Toothbrush!,5,This toothbrush works great. I feel like my teeth are so much more clean now than before using a manual brush. It gets more of the plaque off my teeth with less effort. The battery lasts a long time and the stand is small and easy to hide in a corner. The replacement heads are easy to change and the bristles are just the right softness.,66
1315,Great value!,5,Good quality at a great price!,6
1316,Great product would definitely recommend,5,Great product would definitely recommend,5
1317,"It’s nice, just didn’t realize there was gonna be a bit of expensive upkeep (replacement heads.)",5,I feel like I’m having a replace the heads more frequently than a manual brush (once a month) and the heads are not that cheap,25
1318,Imitation.,1,"I bought this again and it's different from my first.
It's made poorly",13
1319,Not that great as people say,3,"This is my first time using electric toothbrush and I ordered this one because of the reviews and the price was good with Black Friday. So I expected a lot. But once I received it and used I was not satisfied. The vibration is too much, when I’m trying to reach further teeth it stops working. Also timer worked for 2 days and then stopped. I have to count brushing time myself.",72
1320,Great!,5,This is a great product!,5
1321,Oral-B Black Pro 1000,1,I ordered two Oral-B 1 Black & 1 White Pro 1000 opened and used the Oral-B Black Pro 1000 first. It stated making a loud noise after a few uses. So I returned both for a refund.,37
1322,It’s great toothbrush,4,"It’s great toothbrush, my only issue is that it die in 3 days and take 36 hrs to fully charge",20
1323,Toothbrush,5,This was a Xmas gift to someone I can’t rate,10
1324,Still the best toothbrush on the market,5,"The new timer is irritating, ones every minute would be enough",11
1325,Should’ve sticked with Phillips,1,"Disappointed for price. I’m switching from a Phillips requiring brush heads that are no longer made. This OralB is very skinny, flimsy, doesn’t fit right on charger, and is mostly white with a black front. Brush head falls off easily. No cover for brush. Brush holder ring is pink which I don’t want or like. Bad design. I don’t know how it works yet since it came with dead batteries. Also only came with one brush head.",77
1326,Great product,5,Easy to use and does a great job,8
1327,Cleans well with vibration timer.,5,Easy use and timer function makes it simple move to the next teeth section.,14
1328,Worked for 2 months,1,"Completely stopped working about 2 months into using it. Won't charge, won't light up, won't turn on. And I'm outside the return window so Amazon won't do anything about it. My previous oral B last 3 years. Super frustrating.",39
1329,Does not hold a charge,1,"We returned our original product after two weeks, the battery stopped holding a charge. Our replacement product stopped holding a charge after 3 weeks. Would not recommend purchasing.",28
1330,Great toothbrush!,5,Have been using the competitions electric toothbrush for years and decided to try these out. I'm sold! They really work on stains and keeping your gum line clean. Braun did it again!,32
1331,Good brush without the extra features,5,"Been using oral b for years. My older one stopped working so I got this one.

Not much has changed expect the color which I really like. And this one doesn't have all the fluff features like blue tooth and such which I had on my old and never used",50
1332,cleans well and I love it. The only reason I rated four stars ...,4,"Works well, cleans well and I love it. The only reason I rated four stars is because unlike other Oral-B Pro brushes, this one doesn't have the light at the top, so it doesn't light up when you use it on your teeth, other than that, I'm very much happy with this product and I would recommend it to family and friends and I actually ordered two because I was so happy with the first order!",76
1333,A perfect model,5,My favorite electric toothbrush. Better than the models I was able to locate in stores. Works perfectly. Recommend it to anyone.,21
1334,Much better than the previous model I used for 2 years.,5,Much better than the previous model I used for 2 years. The timer is great and it has a notification light to tell you when it needs to be charged.,30
1335,Keeps the tartar from building up on your teeth and gum line,5,"Comfortable to hold.
Used to clean teeth. Works great.",9
1336,Works great,5,Works great,2
1337,Best clean possible that's not the dentist,5,I have no complaints here. I love this thing. My teeth have never felt cleaner and I now refuse to go back to to normal hand brushing. Easy to charge and use. The charging station makes me love it that much more since I dont have to mess with batteries at inopportune times.,53
1338,Good enough..,5,Great toothbrush.,2
1339,Great product!,5,Very effective and convenient!,4
1340,As advertised,5,"Great product just as advertised. Nice, compact and vibrates to remind you to move to another quadrant of your mouth. Vibrates a few more times when your two minutes is up but will keep going if you want to continue brushing hard to reach spots.",45
1341,Good,5,"Works ok, comparing to the old model I used before, there is no slow speed, only one brushing speed.",19
1342,Works great!,5,"I really like it. I didn't care to have one with all the bells and whistles, and this one is perfect. I tried out an off-brand electric toothbrush a while back, and I didn't like it mostly because the head didn't feel secure when I used it. This one works great. The toothbrush head feels secure. The charge time lasts for over a full week brushing twice a day. And more importantly, my teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists. For the longest time I was someone that felt like a regular brush was just fine, and did the job. Now, I don't think I could ever go back. 5 stars for me.",116
1343,Powerful cleaning,5,I didn’t realize how weak all my old electric toothbrushes had been until buying this one. My teeth feel MUCH cleaner now than they used to.,26
1344,Don’t waste your money,1,I hate this toothbrush with a passion. It is SO messy and gets toothpaste all over my bathroom unless I stop it every single time I take it out of my mouth to rinse my brush. I would rather use a $2 brush from a drugstore than this thing ever again. Wish I wasn’t outside of the return window for a refund.,62
1345,Works great,5,My second Oral B brush. Does a great job. Just ask my dentist,13
1346,Easy to use,5,"I really like the timer, nothing to set up just paste and use.",13
1347,Can be a little rough,4,Worked as described but a little rough for kids teeth and gums,12
1348,Bought a Pair!,5,"I bought one for me and for my husband. Although we haven’t all the fancy features yet, we both love them and they always make me teeth feel clean without having to push super hard.",35
1349,Works Like It Should,5,This electric toothbrush works like it was advertised. I say this as the grandson of the original mechanical toothbrush. When I'm finished brushing my mouth/teeth are absolutely clean! I am now waiting for my dentist to tell me about my gums and reduced plaque,44
1350,Don't overthink it,5,Bought some replacement heads off ebay and use this to keep my teeth cleaner than they would be with just a manual brush. Get by just fine without the fancy ultra-expensive ones; they may be a bit better but as long as it's electric you'll get your teeth plenty clean.,50
1351,Unreliable!,1,"I loved this toothbrush until it stopped working. I've only had it 3 months and the battery won't charge. I never thought to check how long the return window would be open, and learning now that's it's only 30 days, it looks like Amazon knows this product is unreliable. Disgsraceful!",50
1352,Always the best!,5,Always there. My last one worked for 12 years.,9
1353,Does what it's supposed to do.,5,excellent piece of equipment. Gets the job done.,8
1354,Works well !!,5,My computer wise son recommended it.,6
1355,Not charging on port. Only had for 3 months,2,It's been great. I've had it for 3 months and charged it about 3 times when red light blinks. This time I went to charge it and it's not doing anything. Tried different plugs and nothing. Very disappointed that after 3 months it's useless. Not sure what to do now.,50
1356,Not sure if it connects to Bluetooth,5,Haven’t tried the Bluetooth feature if it exists. My old oral B was crapping out after over 10 years of use. This replacement works great.,25
1357,Leaves mouth clean and refreshed.,5,Pretty good. Strong brushing action. Mouth feels comfortably clean and refreshed after use. Takes up minimal space. Looks nice. Can’t ask for much more.,24
1358,Works great!,5,"My dentist recommended me to start using an electric toothbrush and this is the one he recommended so I bought it.
I have periodontal disease so it's important to take the best care of my gums. Highly recommend!",38
1359,"Horrible battery life, not built to last",1,"The battery is not built to last. After using it a little over an year, the battery keeps dying after every single use. Look for a different product",28
1360,Battery lasts less than a year,1,"This was my 4th oral b and all of them last less than a year, batteries stop charging after about 11 months.",22
1361,Disappointed in Oral-B,1,"I threw it in the trash! This model was so hard on my teeth and gums the different modes find not work. I should have returned it as defective, but I'm not sure that was the problem I believe it was poor design.",43
1362,Oral b toothbrush,5,"Very pleased with this toothbrush.
Works very well.
Great price
Highly recommend
Thank you",14
1363,Good toothbrush,4,"Good toothbrush, which seems much stronger than my previous Oral B [which lasted 9 years]. The only issue is that the included brush has a long hole in it which fills with water, and requires removal and drainage after each use.",41
1364,Five star.,5,This thing is powerfull!!! I'm new to the electric toothbrush and after the 1st use I realized...I've been missing out. The pulsing for each quadrant is a foolproof way to make sure all your teeth get the proper love and attention.,41
1365,Nice toothbrush,5,No,1
1366,It’s like a visit to the dentist,5,Does a great job keeping my teeth clean.,8
1367,Good power toothbrush,5,"I like this toothbrush. The 30 second vibration is useful, but not really necessary for me. The main thing is it holds a charge well, it's easy to clean, and it does a great job brushing my teeth.",38
1368,I will never go back to manual brushing.,5,"I used to hate brushing my teeth and it showed. I got one of these and I am never going back to manual brushing. This makes it so simple to clean your teeth and with the built in timer, you definitely brush for the recommended 2 mins. My dental care went up considerably after buying this and getting a water pic.",61
1369,Great Product - Highly Recommend This Toothbrush!!,5,"Excellent product, vibes every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants and gives one last long one at the end (I usually brush my tongue after that one before shutting down the unit).

The heads come with different colored rings to identify them which is helpful if you bought more than one (like I did).

The very first day, my fiance dropped mine (of course) and knocked it hard onto the ground, but the motor didn't stop working and the toothbrush still charges and brushes just as it's supposed to (I bought two, one for each of us, and there's no difference in the intensity or charge time). It does take a really long time to charge, but all you need is is one day plugged in and you're good for a week (or a long weekend get away on one full charge is more than enough!). I'm very pleased with this product, there's no loss of power or slowed vibrations when the battery gets low and needs to be charged, and the warning light is very convenient (no need to guess when you need a charge).

The replacements heads are no more expensive than a regular toothbrush. If you have weak gums (like I do) or just want a cleaner feeling in your mouth, go for this toothbrush, it's worth the one-time investment for what it does for your oral health!",234
1370,You won’t be disappointed,5,I liked this because it wasn’t real expensive and it works just as good as the high paying ones!,19
1371,Long lasting battery and great timer,5,"Great brush. This is my second after the first battery started going bad. It took that one probably 4 years to die out. I like the timer, and it has helped make sure I don't brush too hard.",38
1372,"30 seconds a quarter, my favorite part",5,"This has a timer that goes off every 30 seconds to get you to move on to the next quarter of your mouth, it's my favorite part!!! My old tooth brush had a timer that buzzed after two minutes, that's a long time to wonder how much time you have left, a long time.",54
1373,Great tooth brush,5,Great cleaning.,2
1374,Whiter Smile,5,"Love this! Noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, and found it cleans MUCH better than a regular brush. Quick warning: it’s louder than expected, so if you’re sensitive this may not be the product for you.",40
1375,Does a good job,4,"Does a good job, and is easy to use. One small caveat: it's very noisy.",15
1376,Works great,5,"After a couple of months unit is still working great. Bought these to replace some previous ones that we had that were about 10 years old, hope these last as long",31
1377,Wow just amazing,5,"I was recommended to buy an electric toothbrush and specifically with a round bristle. I immediately felt the difference, my teethes feels way smoother , especially the ones all the way in the back.",34
1378,Made form a real good co.,5,"My last still working 20 yrs later,bought their shaver to, batteries last a long time.",15
1379,Tooth fanatic (keep 'em clean),5,"To my surprise, this works better than I ever suspected. Great incentive to keep brushing longer than usual. I'm sorry I waited so long! Think kids should get started on this early. Comes with an extra head and replacement brushes easily available at Amazon.",44
1380,Pleased but Disappointed,2,Pleased that I got many years from my previous Oral-B (recharging work out). Disappointed that new 2-month-old one ‘sputters’ and sounds like something inside is loose.,26
1381,Bad battery life,3,"Good enough brush for the price, but requires constant charging. I usually get three brushes with it before it dies again.",21
1382,Great results,5,"After just a couple of weeks of use, my dental hygienist says my teeth look great!",16
1383,Horrible,1,Quit within one week.,4
1384,a decent rechargeable electric toothbrush,4,"No frills here, this is a basic electric rechargeable that works just fine. I've used mine for a few months now without any issues. Had a bunch of generic brush heads and they fit just fine. the charger is nice and small won't take up much bathroom space. It gives you the reminder every 30 seconds when brushing which is nice. It's not the quietest thing compared to the more pricey ones but it's not jack hammer loud.",78
1385,Clean,5,"I've been using a sonicare for years, this gets my teeth a lot cleaner. More like when I get a cleaning at the dentist!",24
1386,Better brush,5,I like this electric tooth brush better than the Waterpick brand one that I had which died after one year. The brush rotates and cleans your teeth better. Hopefully it lasts longer since the other one didn't last long enough to use all the replacement heads I bought.,48
1387,Love this item,5,Love this item. The fact that this is water proof when cleaning is so great idea. Would recommend this.I just would like to recommend the signal or alarm for every 30 seconds should not only be by vibrate. It should be with a little sound. I was waiting for it the whole time.,53
1388,I feel really dumb for never investing any money into a REAL toothbrush,5,"This is such a necessary thing in my life right now. I feel really dumb for never investing any money into a REAL toothbrush. It does all the work for me and it's like a massage in your mouth. I am terribly lazy but I make it a point to always brush at least twice a day with this. I usually did brush twice a day prior to getting this but sometimes people forget, y'know? Invest in your health, buy this. The cheapest version of their line of electric toothbrushes. You can get some tongue scrapers for 10 dollars and they do the job.",104
1389,A nice electric toothbrush,5,"It’s a really good electric toothbrush. I chose this one over the Phillips Sonicare because of the brush head; it gets around my teeth easier. The timer is handy too, 30 seconds for each section of your mouth.",38
1390,A little hard but works well.,4,The brush is a little hard so if you like soft bristles you might want to get soft heads for it. Very powerful and works great.,26
1391,very glad I purchased this based on Amazon reviews,5,"I am very, very glad I purchased this based on Amazon reviews. The price and the quality of clean you get from this ebrush is well worth the purchase. Of all the products I have bought over the last year, I would probably rank this toothbrush as the best. Holds a charge well and does an excellent job of cleaning and polishing the teeth. Excellent purchase.",66
1392,Tooth saver,5,"If you don’t have an electronic toothbrush yet, what are you waiting for! I noticed I was missing a lot of spots near my molars in my brushing, and also wanted to get in the habit of not brushing my gums so hard. This was the perfect solution! A little pricey, but well worth the investment. Charges fast and lasts a long time. Also very easy to change heads, and there is such a variety to choose from when it comes to Oral B. Definitely recommend.",86
1393,Great toothbrush,5,"Excellent toothbrush. If you've never used a powered brush, this is a good one to get.",16
1394,Works very well teeth feel great,5,Product works very well,4
1395,Works wonders,5,My teeth weren't in great shape when I purchased this. They were receding and were bleeding some. I had been using a rotating crest spinbrush. This one is hands down a better toothbrush. It has restored my teeth in to healthy teeth and gums.,44
1396,Great quality,5,Great item,2
1397,"Very poor battery life, very loud, not durable",1,"Purchased on may 2020 and after 6 months of use the battery doesn’t work at all. It is not an expensive toothbrush, and you can notice even in the first use that it is sooooo cheap. Not to mention that I do not have sensitive teeth and yet this toothbrush was way too aggressive for both my teeth and my family members teeth. Do yourself a favour and purchase one that is worth the money.",75
1398,Good purchase,5,Pleased with this device. My first electric toothbrush. Easy to use. Can tell a difference. Replacement heads are expensive but can be bought on eBay much cheaper.,27
1399,Battery quickly degrades takes forever to charge,3,Battery quickly degrades when only charging when red light comes on and only one user. 6 months on it lasts for about 3 days before charging. Takes about 18 hours to fully charge,33
1400,Weird,4,"Who cares if it is ""Bluetooth"" or not? The timer times faster than I'd like, so I ignore it.

It also came w/ only one brush, so I had to purchase another & the brushes are not compatible w/ other models...",41
1401,Works Great,5,I like the through and deep cleaning. I spend less time brushing and my teeth are cleaner.,17
1402,Broken,1,Broken,1
1403,Shiny teeth,5,"Cleans my teeth really well and makes brushing easier, not that it was that hard before, but yeah",18
1404,Amazing cheap toothbrush,5,It’s a fantastic toothbrush. My teeth are so clean now.,10
1405,Great Brush to Buy,5,I like how clean my teeth feel (and look) after using this toothbrush. The charge lasts about a week so that's convenient. Great purchase and affordable. Glad I bought it.,30
1406,Teeth feel clean,3,"My teeth feel clean but this Oral B rattles while using. I had a different Oral B that did not rattle (gave it away). Otherwise, it cleans my teeth and gums well!",32
1407,Too strong,3,Hurts my teeth / destroyed my gums after a week. Way too aggressive. Will be buying sonicare.,17
1408,"Brush battery did not even last 3 months, If you want buy it from Costco so you can return it.",1,The batter discharges within 15 seconds. I do not recommend this product since there is no guarantee. It is a hassle. Returns on Amazon are only for 30 days. Buy it in store such as costco if you want so you can return it.,44
1409,Love the black,5,Same great toothbrush but in black!,6
1410,Helps to get rid of unwanted plaque,5,"I will say I wish the loudness of the toothbrush was less. But, this toothbrush has helped me get some of that hard to reach plaque. It leaves my teeth feeling clean.",32
1411,Too wide,2,The toothbrush is too wide. It is hard to fit in between my cheek and side to back teeth.,19
1412,Very good electric toothbrush,5,Very happy with this product it does what it advertises to do,12
1413,Good toothbrushes!,5,They are great tooth brushes!! :) Replacement heads need to be more affordable.,13
1414,Solid construction. Waterproof. Annoying pulse.,4,"Nice that it’s water proof. Annoying that it cuts power (and not in a subtle way) in pulses every 30 sec. as it builds up to the 2 min mark. Sequence as follows: 1 pulse @ 30 sec, 2 pulses @ 1 min, 3 pulses @ 1.5 min, 4 pulses @ 2 min, and then restarts the sequence. Also, once the battery performance declines (as it gets close to its max recharge cycles) you can’t replace it.",77
1415,Awesome Value,5,I’m so happy with this toothbrush and even happier that I didn’t waste my money on one with all the bells and whistles.,23
1416,As prescribed by my dentist,5,"My dentist said get a electric toothbrush and let it do the work, and it was suggested I get this particular toothbrush. I'm not disappointed and any aspect of the purchase.",31
1417,No Bluetooth or time function for this model,4,"There’s no Bluetooth or time function on this model. But I like this toothbrush. It’s a little weird at first because I am used to using bigger toothbrush heads, so switching to a smaller to a toothbrush head like this one, was different for me.",45
1418,I’ll never go back!,5,"I’ve never used an electric toothbrush, but this has been so easy to use that I’ll never go back! One charge lasts quite a while, and it cleans very well while at the same time being gentle. Bought like four for gifts and they love it too!",47
1419,Oral B,5,Product like I want,4
1420,Works how it suppose to,5,"I mean its a electric toothbrush,everything works",7
1421,Won’t even last you a year.,1,"Love this toothbrush, but I’ve had it for 9 months and it will no longer charge. I keep it on the charger all day/night and only take it off for use. Now I use it for a couple of seconds, and the red light starts blinking. Super disappointed.",48
1422,"I like it. It gives my teeth that ""jus left ...",4,"I like it. It gives my teeth that ""jus left the dentist"" feeling. However I thought it was supposed to indicate when I had brushed for the sufficient amount of time but it does not. It just keeps going and going and going until I shut it off. However, it does buzz when it is time to switch sides!",59
1423,Works,5,It works and seems to have a pressure sensor so I don’t brush too hard,15
1424,It stopped working after 3 days,1,I wanted to give the product zero stars because it stopped working after 3 days.,15
1425,Did not shut off after 2 minutes.,3,Cleans good but doesn’t stop after it’s done.,8
1426,I'm really happy with this product,5,"I'm very impressed by this toothbrush, is the first time I used at battery power toothbrush and it cleans up my teeth 100% better than regular toothbrush.",27
1427,However my dentist recommended it so I bought this one and it is ...,5,"I never had an electric tooth brush before, I thought the battery ones were the same. However my dentist recommended it so I bought this one and it is a wonderful experience and made it easy to brush more often. Excellent product! I'm buying one for my wife too!",49
1428,"Have been using it about a month and like it, think it's a keeper",4,"This is my first rechargeable toothbrush (had a battery powered brush previously), so I can't really make many comparisons, but it does leave my teeth feeling very smooth and clean. The vibrating, brushing action is quite vigorous compared to the battery toothbrush. I switched to a flossing type brush head because a few times the original brush head didn't get everything in between teeth. Have been using it about a month and like it, think it's a keeper.",78
1429,A good toothbrush,5,Work fine cleans easily,4
1430,Great product at a great price,5,Perfect electric toothbrush that does the job well,8
1431,I really like how clean this makes my teeth feel,4,"I really like how clean this makes my teeth feel. I am particular about brushing my teeth because bad teeth run in my family. After I brush with this, I feel like my teeth are incredibly smooth. It's very satisfying. I don't find the pulsing annoying and it you turn the toothbrush off for a moment to spit, it remembers where you were for a short period of time.
The charge is pretty good too- I will run for a little over a week without charging.",86
1432,Cleaner teeth,5,This makes brushing teeth a breeze. Love it,8
1433,Nice toothbrush,5,Really good toothbrush.,3
1434,Good toothbrush,5,Very useful.,2
1435,LOUD Brush,1,Worst electric toothbrush I have ever owned. My SonicCare died and I was looking for a reasonably priced replacement. This brush is very loud and was harsh to use. I threw it out and and bought a new SonicCare. Live and learN.,42
1436,Great product,5,Love this product. My old one stopped working after about 15 years or so. Amazon had the best price.,19
1437,Great,5,Really does a great job of cleaning my teeth.,9
1438,Defective toothbrush,2,"This is the second Oral-B toothbrush I’ve purchased. There is something wrong with this one; I think the lower part of the toothbrush is leaking bc it keeps leaving a gross, rust-colored stain on the battery charger stand. I clean it every night, & it’s back the next day. Very dissapointing",51
1439,Love This Thing...,5,I wish I had purchased one of these things 10-years ago. I love it. Talked my wife into trying it as well. Now she loves it also. Teeth are cleaner. Gums no longer have any issues. The 30-second repeat timer works well.,42
1440,Same price as the box stores but better because you don’t even have to get out of ...,5,"Same price as the box stores but better because you don’t even have to get out of bed to order them and then they show up at the front door! All 3 of our kids have braces and the dentist recommended these! They work great, replacement heads are cheap and the kids love them!",54
1441,I gave this toothbrush 4 stars because I think it ...,4,"I gave this toothbrush 4 stars because I think it could be a little less powerful. You have to get used to it. It's very strong when you first start using it. It works very well though. My teeth feel really clean when I'm done, and the battery lasts a long time.",52
1442,"Very loud unit, but powerful.",4,"It's quite noisy but powerful. Can't know when you're using which function, so abit useless having them.",17
1443,Didn't realize what I was missing using a regular toothbrush,5,"A good review or picture of the item doesn't do it justice. It is literally like a trip to the dentist with each use and makes the old toothbrushes useless and seriously outdated. I was skeptical from judging the book by it's cover but it's really 5+ stars, buy this and you'll see the difference in brushing.",57
1444,Good!,3,Only thing I dislike is the plug.,7
1445,Great brand,5,Love electric tooth brushes. Good brand I always buy for myself. They last a very long time. I bought this one specifically for my boyfriend,25
1446,Overpriced but we,4,Over priced but it does clean well and my son is very happy with it.,15
1447,Take this brush for a spin,4,"I was a long-time Sonicare user and thought I'd give this a chance. The concept seemed mechanically weaker to me, but upon use, it turns out I prefer this over Sonicare. If you have stubborn plaque in-between teeth and at the gum line, I think this works better. With Sonicare, the brush moves so fast, it almost creates a rectangular barrier of force that prevents you from pushing it between teeth. However, this rotates much slower, and the circular brush can get in crevasses better. My one complaint is: for whatever reason, where the brush contacts the charging station, gunk builds up on a daily basis. I think the water after brushing runs down the brush and collects on the base, which has raised edges. I try and dry the brush as well as I can, even using a towel, but every week I need to scrub the gunk off the base. It also causes the toothbrush to stick to the base, so when you lift it up, the base comes with it. I never had that problem with any of my Sonicare brushes (out of 3).",187
1448,This toothbrush cleans your teeth like a manual brush never could,4,"This toothbrush cleans your teeth like a manual brush never could. Cuts through and prevents plaque build up in usual spots if you are prone to plaque build up like I am. The battery lasts 5-7 days with brushing twice a week which isn't too bad. I wish it would last a little bit longer, but it charges very quickly. If you are a manual brusher on the fence about this brush, don't hesitate and just buy it. It's fantastic.",80
1449,A great tooth cleaner.,5,Going to an electric toothbrush doesn't always feel natural or easy. I've tried several times. I love this one. Great cleaning ability and the bristles are gentle enough to get close to the gums.,34
1450,Functional & Good quality,5,This product does a very nice job and is fairly priced. I compared it to many high priced electric tooth brushes and the reviews all agreed in the quality and function without all the bells and whistles.,37
1451,Works great! Charge holds really well! Perfect for 12yr old hands to hold,5,"Bought this for my 12yr old sons stocking. He gets a new one every yr, typically a much cheaper one. Spending a bit more was the best decision ever. He loves it so much I have to stop him from brushing to much.",43
1452,I would not advise purchasing this toothbrush. ago.,1,"When I received my toothbrush, I was elated. It was my first electric toothbrush, and I’m over 60. The toothbrush worked fine for about three weeks, after that the battery would not charge fully, and after the fourth week, the toothbrush would not come on at all. I have been using the toothbrush manually, since I purchased it over 2 1/2 months ago. I would not advise purchasing this toothbrush.",70
1453,Really good,5,Great product and effective.,4
1454,Great purchase,5,"Great purchase. Gets the job done, I almost purchases the more expensive toothbrush with all the bells and whistles, and realized I didn't need the extras. I needed a solid toothbrush with a rotating head to clean my teeth and its doing just that.",44
1455,Don’t buy this one,2,"After 1 week, the toothbrush became loud and would skip a beat- not quite stopping but a hesitation. Changed batteries, made sure all contacts were clean but noise is really irritating",31
1456,Great Toothbrush,5,"This is my first power toothbrush and it works great. Easy to use and cleans every corner, which I couldn't get by ordinary toothbrush. Will try other brush heads too. Oh, and it was a bit surprising that it needs so much time to be charged, but that's ok.",49
1457,These are recommended by my dentist,5,"With the oral B toothbrush, my dental cleanings are faster and I get compliments that I am doing a good job. For someone like me with a very small mouth, it makes flossing so comfortable.",35
1458,As expected,5,As expected,2
1459,good tooth brush,5,I bought this to replace my worn out sonic tooth brush which I don't think really cleaned my teeth very well. I have used this one for several weeks and I really like it. The small head gets into tight places and I feel that my teeth are cleaner. I am impressed with the long charge the battery holds.,59
1460,Love it,5,I'm an Oral B fan so this works great for us,11
1461,Big upgrade,5,I really don't care for the 30 second reminders while I'm brushing but other than that it a great toothbrush that's good for getting into small spaces.,27
1462,Less than a month & it died .. very unhappy!,1,"I purchased bc it was Amazon recommended, it was noisy but I was prepared to accept. Then less than a month later it died! Very unhappy, I’m not returning bc who would want to handle a used toothbrush in the current crisis?",42
1463,The best!,5,This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever owned! The timing function is so nice and the brush gives me a dentist visit cleaning.,25
1464,Not a fan,2,"Pros:
- good at getting hard-to reach places.

Cons:
- doesn’t stay charged for very long.
- stops working for brief moments while using it in different angles.
- replacement heads are pricey",33
1465,This toothbrush is the BEST,5,I bought these for the three of us in the family- everyone raves about them. I always feel like I’ve just left the dental office from getting my teeth cleaned 🙌🏻,31
1466,Love it,5,The best toothbrush,3
1467,Great for the gums,5,Terrific product. Don’t know why I waited so long to buy an electric toothbrush. It’s even helped with my dentist’s concerns about my potential periodontal disease. I would highly recommend this brush. Very reasonably priced as well.,37
1468,Rusted within a month,1,"Works great but the metal part that the head attaches to started to rust within a month of me getting it. Noticed when I went to change the head, but was already outside the return window. Clearly not a water resistant material.",42
1469,Good first time purchase,5,"This is my first electric tooth brush. I have and it for several months, and so far it is still functioning as well as it did when I first bought it. No frills, just press the button and it vibrates to indicate you to switch quadrants. No complaints so far.",50
1470,Sleek good brush,5,I like that it doesn’t take batteries and requires charge,10
1471,Needs recharging too quickly,2,I used this product for 2 1/2 months and then it began to need recharging after 3 or 4 uses. Called Oral B and they would not honor 60 day warranty even though the product is obviously faulty.,38
1472,Happy with Product,5,I purchased 2 of these and so far both toothbrushes are working great. I have been to the dentist since I've purchased my toothbrush and the hygentist could tell a difference. I can tell a difference in my teeth n the build up since using this product. Happy with product so far.,52
1473,good item,5,everything ok,2
1474,Loses its charge quickly,4,Good product but loses its charge quickly.,7
1475,Toothbrush,5,I use to think electric tooth rushes were for lazy people but this thing really cleans the teeth much better than a normal toothbrush. Would buy again.,27
1476,No es grato de usar. El motor es fortísimo,2,"Quedé muy desfraudada. El motor es fortísimo, gira fuerte, duro, a veces temo si tendré alguna pieza frágil este limpiador la hará estallar. Voy a comprarle los cepillos suaves a ver sino pierdo la compra total. No es grato de usar",41
1477,Good toothbrush,5,"Works well battery lasts about a week between charges, and does a good job on cleaning. Small bristles take getting used to",22
1478,No bluetooth; No timer?,5,I feel like I’m getting a deep clean every time I brush my teeth!! I really recommend this to anyone!,20
1479,Great,5,My first electric toothbrush. Much better and faster than regular toothbrush.,11
1480,Works like a jack hammer in your mouth (in a good way) !!!,5,When I finish brushing my teeth feel like they do when I'm walking out of the dentist's office after a cleaning!!! Much more powerful than my last electric toothbrushes. JUST DELIGHTED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!! Can't wait till my next visit to the dentist to see how much plaque I DON'T have!!!,51
1481,Replaced same one after 7 years,5,The last one lasted seven years of brushing twice a day for four minutes a day and this seems identical so I am quite happy.,25
1482,JUNK,1,This was sent to me as a replacement. The first one would not charge. Light continues to blink green after 72 hours of charging. I have sent both back and requested a refund.,33
1483,Charge time too long,4,"I’d give it 5 stars but it takes too long to charge. If you put it on in the morning after brushing, it’s not yet charged to brush your teeth before bed. Same is true for the reverse, so if you purchase this, be sure to keep another toothbrush handy for when you’re charging.",54
1484,Great toothbrush,5,Very clean teeth!!!,3
1485,Junk,1,I started using the toothbrush after I fully charged it and it will run for few seconds then starts shutting off and on does it all the time so motor must be junk or wires or something disconnecting.,38
1486,Very clean teeth!,5,I have been using it for about a month now and my teeth feel so much cleaner! I like the 30 second notifications too. They help me spend about the same amount of time in each quadrant of my mouth. Great product! Seems like good quality too.,47
1487,Good toothbrush for the price,5,I've owned more expensive electric toothbrushes and in my opinion this model and some dental floss with keep your teeth clean enough between dental hygienists visits,26
1488,Take the work out of brushing.,5,Great product you just put a pea size amount of tooth paste and gently hold it against your teeth gently rocking it from side to side. It takes the work out of brushing and actually makes it kind of fun. The cleaning you will get from this is far superior to a regular tooth brush.,55
1489,Works great.,5,works great to keep my teeth clean and bright.,9
1490,Convenient and Effective,5,Everyone should have an electric toothbrush. This one is very good and good price,14
1491,Not as good as the old ones,3,"The button for on/off is located in the wrong place, the power is not as good, but U can still get a good cleaning, just takes longer and the handle is much smaller.",33
1492,All you need,5,"Well, I read another review about this electric toothbrush, and they said getting this one was all you need. Some of the other ones have fancy smancy features like blue tooth and stuff. So far this has been great. Just buy it. There's no way that brushing your teeth with a regular toothbrush comes even close to what this can do, in my opinion. I should have bought this a long time ago. And this brand seems to be really solid.",81
1493,Awesome,5,Vibrate action is gentle but effective,6
1494,My teeth just feel cleaner,5,I like that it reaches all the little nooks and crannies!,11
1495,Nice clean teeth,5,"Product works great, better than my other electric.",8
1496,Great product,5,"Great product
Great Value",4
1497,Works,4,Works as advertised. Vibration makes me feel nauseous though,9
1498,Excelente producto,5,"Batería dura alrededor de 1 semana usándolo diariamente, buen producto, limpieza profunda.",12
1499,Fantastic battery life and power!,5,"A very big step up compared to the Oral-B 500. When they say 300% more cleaning, it is a true statement. A must have for everyone of all ages in order to keep healthy teeth.",35
1500,can't be beat for the price,5,"I honestly can find no complaints about this toothbrush. A little background, I ordered one of these for myself about 2 years ago and its still going strong, this one is for my wife. She originally purchased the sonicare equivalent of this when i bought mine. She had used it and hadn't really had more than a few minor problems with it until a big one! When you replace the heads on it, the entire top of the head unscrews and there is a cavity in between the toothbrush and the head, a huge cavity. well this thing had mold growing inside of it, no thanks, so that one hit the trash and now this is her new one and she absolutely loves it! plus she's terrible about pressing too hard on her teeth with it and the pressure sensor is fantastic because it stops her from hurting herself!",149
1501,Does the job well.,5,Overall this is a good brush. A bit loud but that’s about the only flaw with it. A worthwhile purchase.,20
1502,Amazing,5,I used to use a sonic care toothbrush by Phillips and I must say I can tell a big difference when using my new Oral B. It’s amazing and my mouth feels so clean afterwards. Highly highly recommend this toothbrush. You will not be disappointed.,45
1503,Number 1 toothbrush,5,I wish the bristles were a little stiffer but it does a sufficient job and also will go between teeth well where the stiffness of the oral B does not,30
1504,Too rough. Get the one you can control speed,4,I didn't connect blue tooth. You might want to get the more expensive one so you can control the speed. This one is a little rough. Maybe there's a softer brush also?,32
1505,A cleaner mouth for a reasonable price,4,Amazing product! After each brush my mouth feels cleaner than ever and my smile is noticeable whiter! The only reason it does not get the full five stars is it can be a little rough on sensitive gums. Although there are supposedly 3 vibrations settings I have not figured out to menuver between them which is another slight downside. All in all great product!,64
1506,Good,5,"Worth the upgrade to an electric toothbrush for sure, the pressure sensor is difficult to tell if it's going off but worth the $40 I paid",26
1507,Great electric toothbrush,5,Dentist told me to get an electric toothbrush & I didn't want anything too expensive or fancy. This one is wonderful - now husband wants one too!,27
1508,"Very basic, average build quality, does the job",4,"Pros:
- does the basic job very well

Cons:
- poor build quality
- a 110v volt charger is bundled when most of the world uses 220v. So, it is better to have bundled a 100-220 v charger. Now one must go buy a charger when travelling?",47
1509,Good but for the price,5,Liked it does a good job,6
1510,Awesome toothbrush,5,Great toothbrush. It makes my teeth feel polished after I use it. And I love the little buzzes it gives you when it’s time to change sides etc.,28
1511,Clean faster and better,5,At first I didn't like it because it felt like I was using a power tool to clean my teeth. Now I love it because it allows me to brush my teeth much cleaner and faster. I have even gotten compliments on my teeth.,44
1512,It does the job,5,Blue tooth for a toothbrush!,5
1513,Gross buildup accumulates inside the brush head. Find another brand.,3,"Spins and cleans well but the little holes and crevices in the head collect a lot of black grime. Thanks to my water flosser I'm able to clean it deep inside where it's hard reach but its disgusting to know that tons of that build up is accumulating inside and causing potential bacteria to transfer back into your mouth. They should really close those holes in the head because it's ridiculous. I've been using it for most of 2018, and I'm looking for another brush now. Fed up with how gross it is to keep seeing the build up that grows inside the brush head.",105
1514,Brand loyalty,5,Had another oral b but after like 8yrs the battery had it. Just like my previous toothbrush this one really does a great job.,24
1515,Best brush for your buck,5,"Does its job well. My teeth feel way cleaner and smoother than they ever did with a regular toothbrush. Hopefully dentist agrees! Timer is intuitive, decent battery life. A little on the loud side, but for the price point (compared to other brushes) it's a non-issue.",46
1516,Effective and efficient,5,"This brush deep cleans the surface and between teeth for a ""just left the dentist"" clean feel in the mouth. It is easy to use. If you are not used to flossing, it may take some time for your gums to adjust, but it is well worth the transition. Highly recommend!",51
1517,I don't need an app on my phone to brush my teeth,5,It does what it is supposed to do without the added expense and complexity of communicating with an app on my phone. Do the ones that cost $100 more actually function any better? I can't imagine how they could.,39
1518,OB toothbrush,5,Fast shipping. And works great,5
1519,Quit after five months of use.,2,"I bought this in July of 2017 and it quit working today (November 25, 2017). That hardly seems worth it to me. I've had three other Oral B electric toothbrushes and two of the four were fantastic and lasted for a few years. Not this one.",46
1520,Game Changer,5,"My mom and I have been using the original Oral-B toothbrushes since they first came out. I stopped using mine about a year ago and went back to using a manual toothbrush bc I felt like it wasn't doing the trick anymore. Then I saw the Oral B Pro 1000 on Amazon and was impressed by the new brush head and thought I'd give it a try. Well, it's AMAZING! Just as easy to use only it cleans remarkably. I felt like I had just brushed AND flossed because it got into every nook and cranny for an amazing clean.

Two days later, my mom ordered one and she was thrilled about the 300% more plaque removal.

If you have an Oral-B, definitely update to this one. If you've never had one, you'll never go back to a manual toothbrush again.",141
1521,Worried it will die soon :(,4,"I'm not sure if it's supposed to always blink the battery emblem while charging but it does.. I'm not sure if mine is defective or it's just cheap.. I'm satisfied with the performance otherwise though I've only had it for 4 days.

The cord is super long & base tiny so tricky to keep balanced on my tiny counter.",59
1522,Great design,5,"I've been using it for a week. The design is well thought out and its simple and easy to use. The 30s and 2min timers are subtle yet easy to detect. The motor strength and cleaning action is just right for me, and I can feel the difference in teeth cleanliness when compared to using a regular toothbrush.",58
1523,Cleans well,5,Polishes teeth just like dentist. Teeth feel clean after use.,10
1524,It's ok. Prefer old fashion tooth brush,3,Seems so stiff to use.,5
1525,Stop working after less than a year,1,"Broken, after less than a year of use. This is the second electric toothbrush from oral B that I purchased, and it ended up having the same problem as the first. After some time it seems like they don’t charge right anymore, and progressively stop working. I will be looking at other brands.",53
1526,Very Good Toothbrush,5,Very good toothbrush. I used to buy the expensive version but this is just as good although it does not have the separate timer. You must keep track of the 30 second quick pauses to get to the recommended two minutes but it is definitely worth the savings.,48
1527,I buy everything on amazon and this is in my top 3 purchases.,5,I buy everything on amazon and this is in my top 3 purchases. My teeth were noticeably whiter right away.,20
1528,Much better than the old rechargeable.,4,"Bought this for my husband. He likes it way better than the sonicare he had before. The only issue was the head that came with it. He says its too aggressive for his brushing style. He usually orders soft bristled toothbrushes. Thankfully the oral B heads are interchangeable, so we are going to order sensitive teeth soft bristled heads for him.",61
1529,I like Oral lot better,5,"I don't think I can go back to regular toothbrush after this. I've used Sonicare in the past but after a month of use, I like Oral lot better. It's easier to maintain because the brush head can come off easily on this one compared to Sonicare. Even brushing feels better on Oral-B. Love the product.",56
1530,Excellent value,5,"Does a great job at cleaning, all over. Simple unit without all the bluetooth overkill. If we could only get one that doesn't have annoying timed pauses.",27
1531,Best addition to my dental hygiene ever,5,Best addition to my dental hygiene ever. It is addictive to wash my teeth with this thing. It is like getting a moth massage. My teeth are way cleaner than when I use a regular tooth brush. I will never go back to regular tooth brushes.,46
1532,I can now never go back to a manual brush,5,"This brush works great, my teeth have never felt so clean. Went back to a manual brush on a overnight trip and didn't feel like my teeth were clean at all. Highly recommend",33
1533,It's unnecessarily loud and it uses loads of battery power,2,"Not impressed! It's unnecessarily loud and it uses loads of battery power, which means I have to fully charge every 2-3 days! It has no additional feature, except loud brushing... I have had cheaper electric toothbrush that had auto shut off, whitening mode etc..",44
1534,Disappointed,3,The battery doesn’t last as ling as I expected. I have to charge it every 2-3 days.,17
1535,This product works great,5,Easy to assemble...you can feel the power of the brush much like your professional dentist tools. This is worth your money. Love how this product buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know it it time to switch sides.,39
1536,10/10 would recommend.,5,This has changed my routine. My mouth feels so much cleaner. I really notice a difference! Also all the options on the tips is a really nice feature!,28
1537,"Noisy, but good",5,"It’s a good product for what you pay for it, just don’t use it in the am when your spouse is trying to sleep it sounds like a chain saw",30
1538,DDS approved,5,"I have been using an electric brush for the last ten years and I have no plans on going back to a manual. This is my second Oral-B; I still have the first though, I just bought new heads and I'll use it to brush my toddler's teeth now. I only wanted a second so I could have them in each bathroom so I didn't have to walk back and forth, trying to figure out where I last put it.

The smaller head is perfect to reach into tiny mouths like my kid and to clean the buccals (facing the cheek) of upper molars. The charge lasts for a long time, but there's no harm in putting it back on the charger when not in use - the directions say it can't be overcharged. With the sensors, you're less likely to damage your gingiva by brushing too hard and causing recession.

I like this particular model because it's slimmer than my original. The charging station is also less bulky. It may not have all the bells and whistles like the others, but it only has one job and it does it well. I have purchased generic brush heads in the past and have had no issues with compatibility. I highly recommend it!",212
1539,"Needs a better battery and charger, otherwise a great toothbrush.",4,"Good toothbrush, but lousy battery life and cheap, slow charger. It takes 2 days to charge it the first time, the charger is that crappy. I believe the specs said it lasts 5 days?? No it doesn't. I killed the battery over a 3 day weekend, but I do brush about 3 times a day.",55
1540,Works great,5,Makes brushing easier .,4
1541,Works great as all Braun products,5,This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush. My first one lasted 10 yrs and I expect nothing less from this one. Recommended by my dentist.,25
1542,Powerful enough,4,"Think it is powerful enough, but disappointed that it doesn't turn off automatically like the Sonicare. Have to pay attention to the pulses to know when the 2 min is up.",31
1543,Loud and Battery Life,4,"This is an overall good toothbrush, however, it is super loud and needs to be charged more frequently than other toothbrushes. It has to be charged once a week with twice daily use.",33
1544,Excellent,5,"Though I love it, I have only used it twice. I have another Oral B I got for $10 and it works just as well. I do not understand the differences other than the price.",35
1545,oral b is the best,5,"nothing cleans your teeth like this product. this was bought to replace one I bought more than 10 years ago.
highly recommended!!!",22
1546,Good product for its price,5,"This electric toothbrush is good some of the information is mislead . On the box it said there is 3 modes but there’s only 1. But it’s a good product for the price, and it cleans my teeth well",39
1547,Better than the sonic...?,5,"So far so good! Great grip, excellent battery life and i dont have that annoying whining you get from the sonic. Lets see how long it will last...I had my sonic for 2 yrs.",34
1548,"Loud, but works well for the price",4,"After using a normal manual toothbrush for all 27 years of my life, this has given me the cleanest post-brushing feeling. I can get a week’s-worth of use with one charge. I took off one star because the noise is loud, and the use time/charge seems short. The light on the handle turns red when it is slowly dying, so you get a heads up beforehand.",66
1549,Battery Fails After the First Use,1,"The indicator light for the battery does flicker once plugged onto the charging port, but the battery never powers the toothbrush after the first use. I did everything according to the instructions during the first use. I washed the brush head and the handle separately under running water. Then this issue happens. Such a waste of time for people who supposedly would use an electric toothbrush to save time.

Already applied for a replacement and will update the review if the replacement fulfills.",83
1550,Wish I would have got one sooner,5,Great tooth brush,3
1551,Love it!,5,"Works great, powerful. Fast shipping!",5
1552,Works great,5,This product works wonderfully. It is very brisk and cleans my teeth well. I am pleased with this product.,19
1553,Definitely recommend clean clean clean,5,Brought as gift for wife and she loves it she says her teeth feel as clean as when she gets professional cleaning from dentists shes begging me to get one to so im going to order another one ..definitely recommended,40
1554,Great Toothbrush,5,My boyfriend purchased this and loved it! No issues so far :),12
1555,Power!,5,I like the power it has & the timer feature. Better than any other I've used.,16
1556,Love it!,5,Very nice. Works well.,4
1557,Works great,5,Powerful,1
1558,Cleans good but cheaply made.,2,"I really like how this cleans. My teeth feel wonderful. However, after only a few weeks use the metal where the toothbrush goes over is rusted. Very disappointing.",28
1559,"You won't be disappointed, which is a WONDERFUL thing.",5,"Purchased this one for my husband, I have the rose gold one. We love these. They have a case that you can charge in also. So easy to travel with.",30
1560,Exactly what I expected and wanted,5,I love this toothbrush. Simple yet powerful. I especially love the feature where it indicates when to switch to another quadrant of your mouth. It makes it easy to brush two minutes each time. Well worth the money!,38
1561,Good cleaning,5,"Works great. Recharge it maybe every two weeks. It gives a little ""hesitation"" every 30 seconds to switch what your cleaning, so can do your 2 min brushing.",28
1562,Good utensile,5,"Great toothbrush, even if a little rougher than old worn out one.",12
1563,No issues. It's a toothbrush.,4,"So far, so good. Works as expected and makes sure my son brushes for two minutes. Also he likes it more than the sonicare because it doesn't vibrate as much.",30
1564,Good electric tooth brush,5,Works great for electric toothbrush does it job and help make my teeth feeling great.,15
1565,A great purchase,5,I love that it has a compact base and it cleans very well. The timer function is very helpful. And there are plenty of options for different heads.,28
1566,Should've Gone Electric A Long Time Ago,5,"This is my first electric toothbrush. I believe that this is one of those things that make life easier. It brushes better than the manual one unless your arm can vibrate insanely fast and hard. I use to think these were for lazy people. But after a month of using this, I don't give a damn; i'm a lazy a** dude!",61
1567,Oral B Thanks,5,I luv oral B ...i hate brushing my teeth. Oral b makes it somewhat pleasurable and definitely healhy.i habe trouble finding sensitive teeth brush replacements.,25
1568,Brush better,5,Just have to get use to the vibration but it's great. Gets those wisdoms. Worth the money,17
1569,Perfect,5,Perfect tooth brush. It circles not side to side. I wish we had these sooner. I bought one and I bought family members these for Christmas. They work excellent and it makes your teeth feel & look squeaky clean !,40
1570,Great product,5,I really like this product. It is small and very easy to use. It is an excellent product!,18
1571,Happy,5,Works great!,2
1572,Doesn't hold a charge,1,Charged as soon as I opened it. Fully charged. Green light....ready to use. Doesn't stay on for more than 10 secs then dies. Never worked since then. Completely disappointed. Was my Christmas gift to myself. Now forced to purchase another elsewhere. Total bummer. Dont waste your time (or money).,49
1573,My teeth have never felt cleaner after brushing and I’m glad I made this purchase,5,Never thought I’d ever spend this kind of money on a toothbrush... but now that I have I realize it’s the only way to go. My teeth have never felt cleaner after brushing and I’m glad I made this purchase. I can’t ever see myself going back to a regular cheap toothbrush.,52
1574,No comparison between this and a manual brush,5,"Embarrassed to admit that I waited later in life to adopt one of these. It does a far better job than a regular toothbrush and my gum health immediately improved (when used after a good water flosser). My dental hygienist was happy, so I'm happy.",45
1575,"Deep cleaning, reasonably priced!",5,"Great toothbrush, cleans your teeth well, if you don’t brush your teeth like ever and use this, you’ll have a brand new smile with no plaque, a great toothbrush at a convenient price!",33
1576,VERY LOUD SOUND,1,"Not only that the sound give me a headache, it also stop functioning right after less then a month. it worked for less then a min and then shot off and needed to be charged again...",36
1577,Underpowered,4,Good toothbrush but underpowered,4
1578,Great Tooth brush,5,Really like this tooth brush it’s so good worth the purchase,11
1579,It feel like it will vibrate my teeth out of their sockets,2,It feel like it will vibrate my teeth out of their sockets! Maybe I'll use it once a month. I got some charcoal tooth paste that works great with an ordinary brush instead.,33
1580,Fantastic Toothbrush,5,I like the way my teeth feel completely clean of all plaque and tartar after I am done using the Oral-B 1000. I prefer this toothbrush over my old electric toothbrush. I highly recommend the Oral-B 1000.,37
1581,Clean teeth,5,I like how clean it gets my teeth. The timer is great. Once I figured out it's not an audible timer. I would have to push really hard to make it warn me for that.,35
1582,Buyer beware,1,Terrible battery and charger! In the morning after it charged all night the battery died while I was brushing my teeth. If I charge something all day and night and only use it twice maybe three times a day and it dies while in use I think that’s ridiculous. I’m returning this product.,53
1583,great,5,awesome teeth feel really silky,5
1584,Great product,5,My last Oral-B electric toothbrush lasted 17 years. This is my first replacement. Thank you Braun for a good product!!!,20
1585,Works great,5,Keeps my teeth clean,4
1586,Love this - But battery life could be better,5,"Excellent performance and light weight. Makes my teeth feel clean and healthy. My only complaint is the battery life, I only get about 3 days out of a charge. Long weekends away or vacation, be sure to bring your charger with you.",42
1587,Awesome brush!,5,"Great toothbrush for the price, perfect! Purchased as a Christmas gift and my brother loves it. He is very picky so I was relived that it worked out so perfectly. Read many reviews and sites for best electronic tooth brushes and this one was among the top ones. Purchase it, you won’t regret it!",54
1588,"Poor performance, LOUD",1,It's way too loud and clunky. Water gets in the inside of the handle and it's not worth it. I wish I could return it.,25
1589,Very clean feeling after,5,It was weird at first but after 2 or 3 days it felt normal.,14
1590,Not as advertised. Older model?,2,It’s still a pro1000 but it doesn’t look anything like the photos. Kinda dissatisfied as this model was on sale at my local store for $25.99 but I chose to get a “nicer” looking one so I ordered it here. I guess I’m keeping it because I need a toothbrush and it works.,53
1591,Poor Charging,2,Item was purchased but not used until after the support/return windows. Item took well over 24 hours to charge then didn't last for more than 4 days and then took another 24 hours+ to charge. Brush works fine when charged but charging delays are not acceptable.,46
1592,Feels like a massage for my teeth,5,I really like this toothbrush and the round toothbrush heads. It really feels like I'm getting a thorough cleaning for my teeth and gums. I also appreciate it rechargeable and easy to keep clean. I don't particularly care for the time function and have figured out if they is a way to disable it.,54
1593,Best electric tooth brush,5,Wonderful electric toothbrush. My old one broke after 10 years so I purchased this one. It works great. I would not go back to a manual toothbrush. It’s great for plaque removal.,32
1594,Oral b,5,Recommended by dentist for an exceptional cleaning,7
1595,Nice brush.,5,Nice brush. Works as exoected,5
1596,Stopped working!,2,"I bought this just over a year ago, and it worked well until recently. Now it will no longer recharge, and a replacement is nearly $50. So I'm less than thrilled with this product!",34
1597,Battery lasted only 1 year!?!,1,I love Oral-B products and have used a different toothbrush for years until the battery wouldn’t charge anymore. This was was great until a week ago and now the battery won’t charge anymore. So I got 1 year out of it. This doesn’t seem right.,45
1598,Has its pros and cons,3,"I like the way it cleans my teeth, but I do not like how noisy it is and I’m not sure if I received a dud but it cuts in and out when fully charged each time I brush. Should have purchased a higher quality toothbrush.",46
1599,Great for the Grandchildren!,5,"Got for my Grandchildren. They use it because it is an electric toothbrush. I got is because the dentist recommended and it cleans off 300% more plaque. I don't know about that claim, but if my Grandchildren will brush their teeth, definitely worth it!",44
1600,Won't buy again.,2,It sounds like a poorly tuned lawnmower.will go back to skincare when this wears out.,15
1601,"This is the replacement for my old oral-B, works fine so far",3,It works fine but not compatible with my previous time clock,11
1602,Definitely a game-changer! Use as suggested and dental health will improve!,5,"My father bought one for me and my dental checkups have been perfect...minimal plaque and no problems. I was so impressed, I bought one for my son.",27
1603,It makes a difference,5,"When I went to my dentist, she saw the difference when I used this toothbrush as opposed to the manual toothbrush",21
1604,It works.,4,It cleans well with the spinning brush.,7
1605,Loved,5,Husband gift love it,4
1606,Love this.,5,Works great. My teeth feel super clean all day. Way better than regular brushes.,14
1607,Bristles too stiff,3,The bristles on this are far too stiff,8
1608,Good selection,5,This tooth brush is al excellent selection and good Price Quality relation.,12
1609,will not charge,1,"This was my second unit. First one would not accept charge from the beginning. the replacement lasted three months and will no longer charge. Excellent product for dental care, even recommended by my dentist. But the charging system needs to be fixed. Reading through the reviews this seems to be a major problem. One would think ORAL-B would have it fixed by now. I'm going to try the 1500 with the Lithium battery. Perhaps that will be better.",78
1610,0 STARS BUYER BEWARE-STOPPED WORKING IN 2 MONTHS,1,"I bought it11/29/2020 and it stopped working February 1, 2021....just outside the return window. I am now stuck with it. I would like a replacement or my money back to try a different brand.",34
1611,Bigger brush head than expected,3,I switched from Sonicare to this model and I like the rotating head but I wish it were smaller. I cant reach the back of my mollars as easy with this model. Overall Im happy but I probably prefer Sonicare to be honest.,43
1612,Toothbrush,4,"Great toothbrush!
Will use for some time",7
1613,Oral b is great,5,Love this electric toothbrush. Works nice and was on sale. Thank you.,12
1614,Great value,5,This was a replacement for another Oral B toothbrush and I love it.,13
1615,So fresh and so clean clean,5,"For $30, IFL this toothbrush. I'm an avid coffee drinker, espresso junkie, whatever you wanna call me and I currently have Invisalign; this toothbrush combats staining soooo well and keeps my aligners nice and clear. The 2 minute 4 quadrant timer is a bonus, reminds me when to switch sides. Takes up very little counter space. Before purchasing this, I contemplated stepping up to the $80-$120 versions, but decided to give this one a shot first since it comes with a 60 (or maybe 90 ) day guarantee. If you just want to get your teeth CLEAN in 2 minutes and don't need a robot monitoring your every move, this one is definitely a gem! No regrets here :) Came with coupons for replacement brushbeads, so I would pick those up at walgreen or cvs when they have double coupons and a sale. The brush heads are super easy to switch out if you have multiple users. As long as you keep it on the charger when not in use, it should be ready to go whenever you are!",179
1616,It’s cool,4,"I’ve never used an electronic toothbrush before so it feels different, but it does a good job of cleaning plaque of my teeth. The first time I used it I felt like my gums were vibrating after use lol. I’m still trying to figure out the timer. But a good product all in all.",54
1617,worked great,5,Purchased as a replacement to the old Braun toothbrush. It worked fine. no issues.,14
1618,Teeth cleaner,5,Cleans well,2
1619,"Oral-B, enough said",5,"It’s a very decent electric toothbrush for the price; however, when you buy a product, you buy a customer support. Oral-b has an excellent customer support satisfaction.",27
1620,Hasn’t be able to charge since I bought it and now I can’t return it,1,Bought this product over 1500 and now I regret it. Writing a review is annoying but this toothbrush just didn’t charge at all since I’ve had it ( 2 days). Now I have to spend money on another toothbrush. I tried to get a cheaper option and ended up screwing myself.,51
1621,well scrubed,5,"well scrubed, teeth feel clean",5
1622,Feels like I just went to the dentist,5,Great buy. Why’d I take so long to get this. Lol.,11
1623,Newer version cheaper made,1,Battery won’t last long,4
1624,Good toothbrush,5,It’s definitely worth the money and usage,7
1625,great toothbrush,5,This is an excellent product at much lower price than others recommended by dentist.,14
1626,Doesn't work after 22 months of use.,1,Product lasted less than 2 years. I went to use it today after charging and it will no longer turn on. Between the cost of new brush heads and the original cost of the brush I lost money compared to just normal brushes or a cheaper electric alternative. Do no buy this.,52
1627,"Good at first, doesn't last",2,"I've had mine for about 6 months. Motor is slowly dying. Any small amount of pressure makes the bristle head stop spinning. Better off paying more for a better product, which is what I'm about to do.",37
1628,Stopped charging after a month,1,A month later it stopped charging,6
1629,Lasted 6 months,1,"6 months in, it stopped taking charge. I will charge it overnight, then use it and the red light comes on again. I have tried a different charger, the charger isn't the issue. Disappointed",34
1630,So far good,4,"Works well, a little pricey",5
1631,The best one out there,5,So far this is my favorite electric toothbrush and I’ve tried all the brands. My dentist recommended using the circle heads because they can get around the molars the best. It’s what they use when finishing a cleaning. This is powerful and has lasted a long time.,47
1632,Excellent toothbrush!,5,Great toothbrush. Cleans just like the dentist office. Really cleans teeth well. Made well!!,14
1633,"Love the Oral B toothbrush, my daughter telling me about it",5,"I always wanted a electric toothbrush and l love the functionality that l get from Oral Black 1000 CrossAction and tell PINCNEL SERVICE TEAM thank you so much , l will buy one more soon",35
1634,"Love it, great toothbrush",5,Excellent product,2
1635,Gaggers beware.,3,Well it definitely cleans your teeth. It is good if you are not a gagger. The size of the head plus the power of the vibration gagged me Everytime I tried using it. I had to use my regular toothbrush to brush my back teeth.,45
1636,Great!,5,"I didn't know that an electric toothbrush can do such a good job, even better then your hand!",18
1637,Does the job,4,"I bought this electric toothbrush to replace my old Oral-B electric toothbrush, which had died after many years of use. So here it is 5 months of use later. Overall, I like it. This model has 1 speed, which I use with the Sensitive Care brush heads. I think I might have done better to get the 2 speed model so I could use the lower speed sometimes; but this is not a major issue. Maybe after this one goes (hopefully not for a long time) I'll look at other models. One thing I notice about this newer model is that the battery seems to need recharging a lot more frequently than I expected; the directions claim that a charge is good for ""up to 7 days of regular brushing"" where reality is more like 4-5 days. (I guess ""up to"" should be read as ""less than"" here.)",148
1638,This was a replacement for my 12+ year old Oral ...,5,This was a replacement for my 12+ year old Oral B which finally gave up. It is noticably more powerful and I had to be careful not to press too hard at first. Having a battery charge indicator is helpful if you do not keep it on the charger all the time. I think it is a bargain considering the price for some electric brushes.,65
1639,Bad toothbrush,2,"Reduces speed for no reason, not very fast to begin with, shuts off and back, on for some reason, has a strange rat.le li,e itsa out to fall apart. Would not recommend",32
1640,Battery is terrible,2,I bought my toothbrush back in Feb-Mar or so of this year and the battery now (Nov) doesn't last for more than 1 minute after a full overnight charge. Literally have to manually brush each time I am a few seconds into the brush. Won't be using again.,48
1641,2 Months and the battery is already dead.,2,"This thing has a crap battery. I bought mine on June 16, 2016. It won't make it through a single brushing without the red light flashing and loosing power today July 30, 2016. The motor is great. The head motion is great. The battery is terrible and cannot be changed. This is the worst of planned obsolescence. Shame on you Braun.",61
1642,So worth the buy!,5,This is amazing! I got it on sale and I will never go to another product again! They are just the best! My teeth have never been this great before and I 100% put it on this product!,38
1643,It does a fine job for what it is,3,"It does a fine job for what it is. I do feel like my teeth are cleaner using this than they are using a manual brush. However, this model is SO LOUD and the design causes it to get gross inside as the gunk builds up inside the brush head itself, which is unappealing for something you're putting into your mouth.",61
1644,Works Great,5,We have used Oral-B for many years. Needed a replacement. The cost and product were just right for our needs at this time.,23
1645,Good item,5,"Clean really good , is better than Sonicare less vibration.",10
1646,Great cleaning,5,Circular motion is much better than sonicare. I love it makes brushing fun and the cleaning is noticeable right away.,20
1647,Love it,5,I love the Oral B.,5
1648,strong action,5,strong action. seems to do thorough job.,7
1649,Not worth it,1,Mine stopped working after less than a month of use. I charged it bc it indicated it needed to be charged and then it stopped working.,26
1650,Better than manual toothbrush,5,My family and I love this toothbrush. Leaves our teeth feeling sparkling clean. My 10 year old make it his business to brush his teeth twice per day now.,29
1651,Excellent!,5,"This is the 3rd Oral-B electric toothbrush I have bought. It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth. It's much, much better than manual toothbrushes.
I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.
.",33
1652,Teeth feel amazing.,5,Holly cow. My teeth feel clean. I just used this for the first time yesterday and my teeth felt like I just came from the dentist. Seriously. I don't know how this tooth brush will hold uo over time yet. I'm hopeful.,42
1653,The best!,5,"Much more powerful than other electric toothbrushes we have had. It’s very basic (no cover for brush head, no 2 min. beep to indicate time to move to another section of your mouth, etc.), but does an outstanding job of cleaning. We love this toothbrush!",45
1654,"Most importantly, it gets the job done!",4,"Battery finally had enough recharges, I guess. I miss the display that I had with the last one that finally bit the dust, so to speak. The new one, I believe, is just as good at cleaning the teeth so I'm happy!!!",42
1655,Nice toothbrush,4,"This is my 2nd toothbrush of this model. The 1st one finally quit recharging. My one criticism is that I wish the batteries were easily changeable. If so, I'd probably still be using my first Pro 1000.",37
1656,toothbrush,5,I like how well it cleans,6
1657,Product,5,It was exactlywhat I ordered and new in box. Works great.,11
1658,Nice product,5,Cleans teeth great. Easy to use.,6
1659,Perfect! That after dentist feel!,5,"Great so far, will update if changes.",7
1660,Love it!,5,I really liked it! Feel like I’m getting a far better clean than a normal toothbrush.,16
1661,This is a pretty loud toothbrush,4,"This is a pretty loud toothbrush. Used to have a real nice soicare one. But for the price, it's works quite well. Bought some generic replacement heads. Haven't had any problems with this toothbrush. Easy to clean and holds its charge for a while.",44
1662,The timer function is perfect and the brush speed is more than adequate to ...,5,"The timer function is perfect and the brush speed is more than adequate to give the feeling of a clean, fresh mouth after brushing. I just wish there is an adapter that I can buy so I can bring and use this electric toothbrush in 220 voltage countries when I travel.",51
1663,My gums and teeth are happier!,5,"Love it! I got the black one for my boyfriend and the blue one for me. Figured the black one would be more manly 😉 During pregnancy and nursing my teeth/gums health went down, and since using my gums have gotten tighter to my teeth and my teeth are whiter! Can not say enough about it. It's super simple, no crazy extras that just take up space. It holds a charge for a long time. And the Chargers take up no space at all. Plus the cords are extra long so they can reach farther!",95
1664,"Great clean, battery could last longer",4,"Great clean feeling, almost as good as going to the dentist for a cleaning. Was really amazed. Excellent value for the price. Wish it came in a different color than black. Also wish the battery lasted a little longer. Charging every 10-12 days seems a bit absurd in this day and age.",52
1665,Tooth brush,4,Works well,2
1666,Awesome Toothbrush,5,Since acquiring my Oral B Pro 1000 toothbrush my teeth and gum health has improved significantly. I am not afraid to recommend this to any one. Works great. Interesting timer feature. Very simple to use. I love it!,38
1667,Terrific,5,"Dude, buy these. Just do it.",6
1668,Very powerful cleaning,5,"I finally had my old Oral B fizzle out on me. This one is lighter and more powerful for sure. I do
enjoy it's cleaning effectiveness more so then my older model.",32
1669,Oral B,5,"So far, after 2 months I really like it. Does a great job of cleaning my teeth. Like the timer.",20
1670,works great,5,works great,2
1671,I like the timer on each quadrant,4,Should have bought one of these years ago. I like the timer on each quadrant. I use to spend extra time brushing my teeth... like about 5 mins... Dentist told me that I was doing more harm than good. This makes it a lot easier to keep time and get my teeth and mouth clean and fresh.,57
1672,Excellent,4,Love it,2
1673,Strong brushing with battery impact,4,"I love this toothbrush a.d would have given 5 stars if the batter lasted a bit longer. That said, the oscillating head does move pretty well so I imagine it consumes a lot of battery.",35
1674,Simple and works great,5,"This is a very economical toothbrush and is light and easy to use. I have an old more expensive model with lots of features ( speed, etc) that I never use. I recommend it and will buy another when the time comes.",42
1675,"Great model for quality, price and function. Let’s hope it’ll last as long as my decade old Oral B",5,"Excellent purchase based on quality, price and function... my other finally broke after almost a decade during a trip in which I had dropped it. (...built solid but had dropped it hundreds of times previously)",35
1676,Good quality brush,4,"A good alternative to other more expensive electric toothbrushes and manual ones. It gets the job done, but the rotation might be a bit too strong. I can already see the difference in using a electronic brush vs a manual one, as my teeth is a lot whiter and my mouth feels a lot fresher after brushing.",57
1677,Works great but loud,4,"Pros: Works great for deep cleaning. Definitely not for sensitive gums. Timer is awesome.
Cons: Very loud and doesn't have a cover for the brush when not in use.",29
1678,They'reeeeeee Great!,5,"Fantastic toothbrush! In my opinion, it is the best all around. For I do not need all the bells and whistles that come with the newer models.",27
1679,Does the job,5,Haven't had a problem. The dentist says my teeth were cleaner this time and asked why. She thought the 30 second timer to focus on the 4 quadrants separately sounded like a good idea.,34
1680,Poor battery life,2,"After a year or so, the battery is unable to hold its charge! I have to recharge every few days which is annoying!",23
1681,Great toothbrush,5,"I got this for my son--he's really good about his dental hygiene, his dentist has no complaints, but his teeth have always been a bit yellow. Less than a week of using this toothbrush, and they're noticeably whiter. He's very happy with it!",43
1682,Amazing clean,5,I bought this electric toothbrush 15 years ago. The internal battery died so I finally had to buy another another one. I love it. My hygienist hardly has to do anything when I go for a cleaning.,37
1683,It's still good,5,"I bought this toothbrush 20 years ago (though it was a Braun). If this one lasts 20 more years, it will be a great investment.",25
1684,Produced for home use only - no 110-220V support,3,"I just cannot understand what the manufacturer thought when producing a toothbrush that you cannot take with you when you travel. Today, all electronic devices that are intended to be used worldwide have 110-220V support. This is just ridiculous.",39
1685,Electric tooth brushes work well,3,"I like the way it cleans. Sure and positive.
For some reason about 25 to 30 seconds into brushing it will cut out for less than a second and then continue on.",32
1686,Not a fan,2,I just don't feel the head of this toothbrush is big enough. Disappointed in purchase,15
1687,Broke after 4 months,1,This was nice until it all of a sudden stopped working,11
1688,Good product,4,Easy to get my son to brush his teeth now,10
1689,Gets the basic job done. Very lightweight.,4,"My old electric had a built in 2 minute timer. This model does a hesitation, nearing 3 minutes. Not precise enough for me.",23
1690,I'll stick with 1500 pro,4,"I had 1500 pro and loved it. My brother said the 1000 pro without one motion function was just as good for 1/2 the price, so I tried it. I prefer the 1500 pro. But I think everyone needs one!
No, I'm not from any company promoting it.",48
1691,Amazing toothbrush,5,It is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I used to use soniccare years ago though that has been long dead. Finally made the purchase for the Oral B and I am never going back. Best toothbrush I have ever purchased. It's timer is probably it's best feature.,49
1692,Works Great,5,This is the first rotating head brush I've used and it seems to work really well. I just sort of slowly run it along my teeth in little circles without any real scrubbing or effort and they feel totally clean when I'm done. I brush my tongue with it too and it's quite effective.,54
1693,works great,5,Cleans teeth the best,4
1694,Highly recommend,5,This is a great toothbrush. I had a cheaper one for years and it finally died and I went with this one after some reading and price comparisons. This gets my teeth really clean- my old one never did this well!,41
1695,Cleans well,4,Works well. I have had several different electronic toothbrushes. This one restate in circular motion and not up and down. I like that. Does a better job of cleaning. It is harder to keep the outside cleaner than my old Sonicare but that’s okay.,44
1696,OUTSTANDING TOOTHBRUSH!!!,5,Best toothbrush we've ever had!,5
1697,clean teeth,5,great.....,1
1698,Buy Sonicare.,2,"This toothbrush works great, but does not reach all the places behind teeth like sonicare. I think I’m going back to using it. My teeth just don’t feel as clean and it doesn’t stay charged as long.",37
1699,Poor battery life and not a very clean feel,3,"Battery life lasted like 3 days with the one I got and I felt like my teeth never really got clean. Also this thing is LOUD, stopped using it when I had night shifts because it would wake up my SO in the other room. Just spring for an upgraded electric tooth brush to really get your value out of it.",61
1700,Not as good as ultrasonic.,1,Rather crude mechanical action which feels like it might vibrate your fillings loose. Lots of dribbling down the stem and onto handle. I will brush by hand until I find another ultrasonic toothbrush.,33
1701,Great toothbrush,5,It’s a great toothbrush! My teeth feel so much more clean using it,13
1702,My dentist approves :),5,"This toothbrush is everything I thought it would be, it’s light, it’s sleek, it’s got a long battery life, easy to clean. My dentist said he’s seen improvement in my gums since I’ve been using it. Very happy.",38
1703,Oral B 1000 Black,5,"300% better than the Oral B 500 model ... well... that is what it is said to be!

Works great!
Built in Charging light is awesome!
Looks VERY cool in black!",31
1704,Good Product,5,I was recommended by my dental hygienist to buy this as one of the top brands of electric toothbrushes. I could not be happier with the product. The price was just right and included a coupon for new brush heads when time comes to replace.,45
1705,Cleans way better than manual brushing.,5,Teeth feel polished!,3
1706,Love this,5,This toothbrush is awesome. It does not have Bluetooth but it doesn’t claim to either so I’m not sure why that’s an option.,23
1707,"If you care about your teeth, upgrade to this ...",5,"If you care about your teeth, upgrade to this brush. Going from manual to this brush I was floored by how much cleaner my teeth are now. This is coming from someone who brushes twice a day with mouth wash and flossing 3 times daily.",45
1708,Cleans teeth beautifully! Great value,5,"Give your teeth. Just from the dentist cleaning feel! Easy-to-use, easy to charge, nothing to dislike!",16
1709,Could be better,2,The battery for this runs off too quickly and I hate how oral b brush heads don’t come with brush cover like Phillip brushes.,24
1710,Better way to brush,5,The Oral B electric tooth brush is easy to use and my teeth feel much better after brushing. Seems to be helping my gums too.,25
1711,Messy,4,"Quite the mess, DROOL everywhere.",5
1712,Super electric tooth brush,5,Great electric tooth brush for the price. I’ve been using a less expensive Oral-B brush for 6 years before it finally wouldn’t charge anymore so expect to get long life out this one. Much more powerful that expected.,38
1713,Toothbrush head,4,"Hello,
I like the toothbrush overall, but the toothbrush head doesn't have the Oral B badge (logo) on it and toothpaste and water get into the head and on the connector. Can you please advise?
Thanks
Diana",37
1714,Love it!,5,"This toothbrush has been so much better than not only a regular non-electric one but even the more expensive ones. The charging dock is small and doesn't take much room, it always has a lot of power even after months of use.",42
1715,worth every penny,5,Having one handle and three brush heads for me and my kids works perfect. Saves a lot of space with just one unit on the counter. The toothbrush itself is totally worth the price. No issues with it and we've been using it for a few months,47
1716,Oral B Black,5,Fantastic clean after using. So much better than a manual brush. Im very happy with this and will continue to use an Oral B even after I wear this one out.,31
1717,SO ROUGH.,1,"So rough, like a jackhammer in your mouth. No idea why this is Amazon's #1 choice for an electric toothbrush. Bought to replace a Phillips Sonicare, just threw this one away and bought another Sonicare.

No travel case, no head cover. No no no.",44
1718,Great toothbrush,5,Great brush. I like it better than my sonic care. I really like the smaller brush head and I feel like I am able to reach those hard to reach areas at the back of my mouth and the back of my teeth. I highly recommend this toothbrush.,48
1719,Exactly what I want,5,"Works great, timer too, and Ive been using it everyday ever since.",12
1720,Worth the buy,5,"It’s simple to use and it is powerful, the timers between brushing is awesome no issues with battery and charging unit I bought 2 one for me and another for a friend I was that much excited about the electric brush.",41
1721,Wonderful,5,Works great for deep cleaning.,5
1722,Excellent,5,Best electric toothbrush I've ever used! Love that it rechargeable and I'm not always changing batteries. The charge lasts for a long time too! Love the timer for each quadrant of your both. Just all around a great buy,39
1723,All the necessary features and none of the fun but unnecessary features,5,Does the job without (to me) unnecessary features like Bluetooth and Tilt/Force sensing. The tilt sensing would not work on the International Space Station anyway (zero G) so I went with this less expensive model.,35
1724,Awesome toothbrush and is really durable and easy to use ...,5,Awesome toothbrush and is really durable and easy to use due to a simplistic design. Only issues is it is a little expensive and only comes with one head no extra replacement which is a downfall and the unit gets dirty very very fast.,44
1725,That the product works.,5,Gives you a good deep clean. The timer I wish had a sound instead of the rotator slowing down fast. Other than that it works great.,26
1726,works well,3,I like it it works as described so far so good,11
1727,quality,5,"I did not use the bluetooth connectivity, but for deep cleaning and the timer it does work great.",18
1728,I really like how it tells you to swap areas to brush ...,5,The smaller head compared traditional toothbrush makes it much easier to reach your backteeth. I really like how it tells you to swap areas to brush by pulsating the head to make sure you brush evenly.,36
1729,Their site for registering is terrible -,1,I can't believe that a large company like Proctor and Gamble would have such a poor site. I gave all information and site took it and then just started spinning. Very Poor!,32
1730,Reliable electric toothbrush,5,Very good electric tooth brush! Hold its charge for at least 2-3weeks. Vibrates when it’s time to move to a different part of your teeth. The toothbrush has helped me to stay focus while brushing for 2minutes,37
1731,Very good cordless toothbrush at a great price.,4,"Very good toothbrush. Not sure how deep it cleans, but so far, it makes my teeth feel well brushed. I like the smaller round head which makes it really easy to get the corners.",34
1732,Affordable Electric Toothbrush,5,Deeper cleaning my teeth feel like I just left the dentist,11
1733,Works great,4,My 9-year-old likes it but I was shocked how loud it is compared to our other 2 of the same brand. She doesn't seem to mind though.,27
1734,Professional clean feeling,5,"I’m excited to brush my teeth! I love it! It feels like I get a professional clean after using it... if you’ve never had an electric tooth brush and are on the line, trust me get one! So worth the money",41
1735,Instantly whiter teeth,5,"My teeth feel clean, smooth and look instantly brighter. I love how brushing with this feels, as well. But sometimes I still use my regular toothbrush if I want to be out of the bathroom faster.",36
1736,As of 5 minutes ago ... it's been thrown in the trash!,1,"As of 5 minutes ago ... it's been thrown in the trash! I purchased this as a """"package free"""" item. I immediately notice how treacherously SLOW it was while holding a LOUD CHURNING sound. I brushed it off as not charged to its full capacity. A month later, I'm done making excuses. My husband purchased a different electrical toothbrush brand and compared side by side the Oral B 1000 is a joke! I'm almost tempted to dig the worthless thing out of trash and record both toothbrushes side by side. You'll notice the difference. Either I was issued a returned toothbrush (I'm cringing at the thought ) or the reviews are for a combination of Oral B electrical toothbrushes. Needless to say, I will never purchase an Oral B electrical toothbrush online.",132
1737,Best brush I've had ever,4,"Great product really helped getting to the back of my mouth. My mouth has never felt this good, the only drawback is its loud, but it woks great for me.",30
1738,Great value that does the job,5,The old electric toothbrush became unreliable so I placed an order for a new one. It arrived right away and was fully charged and ready to use the next day.,30
1739,Bought for my husband,5,"I owned one, and i wanted my husband to have one too. He loves it. Works great! Great value.",19
1740,Super durable.,5,"Have been using the same one for 4 years. Still works like new. And the battery lasts for about a week and a half with 2 uses daily.
The replacement Toothbrush heads are ridiculously priced though.",36
1741,Best toothbrush!,5,"Excellent toothbrush. Easy to clean, easy to charge. Leaves my teeth very clean.",13
1742,Byeee Sonicare,5,"I love this toothbrush! I’ve used Sonicare for years, which is fine, but I found this cleaned my teeth far better. I really like the cross action and maybe I’m crazy, but I swear my teeth looked whiter after just one use. I was due to use my bleach trays but I’m going to hold off and see if I need to. Either way, I love how clean it makes my teeth feel! Side note: I do have pretty sensitive gums & teeth so I had to ease up a bit on the pressure....easy enough.",95
1743,Goood,5,Good,1
1744,Works great.,5,Not much to say. Works great and a very well built product.,12
1745,but this one is exactly what you’d hope it’d be like. My mouth feels so clean and my teeth ...,5,"I have never owned an electric toothbrush, but this one is exactly what you’d hope it’d be like. My mouth feels so clean and my teeth feel polished afterwards. I’ll never use a regular toothbrush again.",36
1746,Works great and Powerful,5,Works great and powerful,4
1747,🌟🌟🌟🌟,5,Good toothbrush love having different colors so we can tell each family members apart,14
1748,Excellent clean,5,It made my teeth and gums feel clean and fresh.,10
1749,Charge length is not as long as advertised.,2,I like the toothbruah but not happy about the length of charge or how long it charges after using for 3 minutes.,22
1750,hesitates a lot,3,Ok but the hesitation,4
1751,oral b,5,great product and fast shippment,5
1752,My Teeth Mouth Feels Cleaners :),5,"There are more expensive ones out there but this is all you need. i have a lot of problems with cavities even when i brush twice a day. All i wanted was a more thorough brushing and this delivers. It claims it should help with whitening my teeth. I have had it 3 weeks. So i cannot comment on that yet. It did take about 15 hours for it to be fully charged so be aware of this when you first get it. Has an easy to ""feel"" timer and and its rechargeable. Works for me!",96
1753,A low cost effective electric toothbrush that is rechargeable.,5,"I bought this for person who is vision impaired. He found it easy to use and finds it
much more effective than his old fashioned manual brush. The rechargeable feature
is a definite plus!",34
1754,Too powerful,3,I bought this for my son and he said it’s too powerful. He chooses to not turn it on because it’s uncomfortable for him to brush with.,27
1755,Love it,5,I like this better than my old sonic toothbrush. I feel like it fits my mouth better and gets everywhere better. Especially the back side of my front teeth.,29
1756,Better than Phillips Sonicare,5,"I had a Phillips Sonicare before this. It was great initially, but it loses its ability to clean over time. Since it relies on high frequency vibrations to clean, it just doesn't do as good a job when parts wear and tolerances increase. The Oral-B uses a rotating motion to clean, so I think it is fundamentally a more durable design. Time will tell, but so far I'm very impressed.",70
1757,Good product.,4,Can’t tell when I am pressing too hard but cleans well. Holds charge and tells you when it needs recharging. Can keep it on the charger.,26
1758,Oral B Pro 1000,1,The tooth brush does not turn off after 2 minutes.,10
1759,Charging Issues,3,Frustrated. Sometimes it charges. Sometimes it doesn’t. I had another electric toothbrush that lasted for 10 years and never had any issues. I had this one less than 7 months and have just been plain unhappy with it. Why does something that was made 10 years ago last longer than an updated version?,53
1760,Worst electric toothbrush I've used...hands down!,1,"I didn't want to believe the negative reviews, but now I am convinced. Buy this toothbrush if you like your mouth being ""jackhammered"". Very harsh. Makes a big mess too. I've owned a number of Sonicare toothbrushes over the years, and never experienced anything like what I have with the Oral-B. That's what I get for trying something different. Save your time and money and look elsewhere. Returning today.",69
1761,Great brushing and a bright smile,5,My teeth are so clean now. Highly recommend.,8
1762,My new toothbrush,5,It works fine...,3
1763,It works if used as directed.,5,Had a dentist appointment on the 9th and they noticed a big improvement. Ill say its because of this toothbrush. Highly recommend.,22
1764,I wish this toothbrush could have worked out. It ...,1,I wish this toothbrush could have worked out. It is way too agitating with the way it vibrates. Buying a sensitive brush head will not solve this.,27
1765,Battery doesn't last. Will not recharge,3,The battery only lasted about 18 months before it quit recharging.,11
1766,Just what I needed.,5,I love the round brush head greatly. Love also that if I go to fast across my teeth it slows down.,21
1767,Works very good,5,Just like leaving the dentist with a cleaning.,8
1768,Amazing electric toothbrush,5,First time owning an electric toothbrush and absolutely love it!! Easy to install and use! Thank you !!!,18
1769,"Do not buy this. You will regret it,",1,"This is a horrible thing. Water drips down your arm like awater fall while brushing, the timer doesn’t shut off at the end of two minutes, the charging lights blink like a crazed light show.",35
1770,Fantastic but,5,Fantastic buy!!! We love these toothbrushes,6
1771,Works great,5,My teeth feel super clean,5
1772,It works if u don’t like foamy toothpaste.,4,"I got 2 and they work great. Except for some reason toothpaste isn’t as foamy, but I don’t mind it. Also I guess it’s small but I’m pretty sure that’s the point so we can get each individual tooth.",39
1773,Great product,5,It never disappoints.,3
1774,Way too expensive for the options,3,"Cheap on/off switch a click would be nice and changing color charging lights, not sure which way the brush should sit on the charger",24
1775,Works well,5,"I use this everyday, leaves teeth feeling great and clean. Love the ability for different style of brush heads.",19
1776,Excelente,5,El cepillo me encantó es fácil de usar y limpia muy bn los dientes,14
1777,Dont buy,1,Bought this and the first time we used it it would not turn on. It was charged and all directions were followed. Not worth the money and move on if you're looking for a toothbrush. So disappointed. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,42
1778,It definitely cleans better than a hand brush,5,"It definitely cleans better than a hand brush. The black color is prone to toothpaste marks but, it looks very executive-like ;-) on the bathroom sink and it forces me to wash it more often. I bought 3 two months ago and all are still working well",47
1779,Good,5,"Its good and do its job, but after long time of use the charge will not be remain as before",20
1780,Worth every penny!,5,One of the best toothbrushes we’ve bought.,7
1781,Step up from vitality,5,Faster and more powerful,4
1782,Fantastic with Deep Sweep Brush heads.,5,"I'm not a big fan of the circular brush heads.
But the cheap sonicare essential handles use replacement brush heads that cost an arm and a leg.
I wasn't about to get caught in that trap.

This cheap Oral-B handle paired with ""Deep Sweep"" brush heads is fantastic.
Replacement brush heads are cheap and easy to come by, and if you ever do want to try a circular brush head, you've got tons to choose from.

I wish oral-B had stuck with the old ""charger"" design though.
Their old one surrounded the bottom of the handle. The new design where the brush sits on top of the charger seems to gather a bit more gunk and requires cleaning more frequently. (not that it's all that difficult to clean)",128
1783,Cleans better than brush,5,"Very powerful, gets my teeth cleaner than a brush, no question. Got it on Black Friday for a great price.

Update: 9 months later this toothbrush has held up to daily use, my teeth are whiter and I have less plaque on my lower front teeth.",46
1784,Amazing,5,Buy this tooth brush! worth the money best electric toothbrush i have ever bought! defiantly would buy again! Battery last along time and charges super fast!,26

1793,You Must have it!,5,Love it,2
1794,Good,5,Good price,2
1795,Great toothbrush!,5,Really cleans my teeth. The hesitation feature helps me to time my brushing. My only con is the vibration noise; does it really need to be so loud? I like that the color is black as it fits my grey bathroom. The old blue Oral-B gave up after a lot of years of daily brushing.,55
1796,New toothbrush. Over older.,5,I am still getting used to this new toothbrush. I am 61 so this one is a first to try. It is a well made item it is just figuring it out on how well it it to work will take time.,42
1797,Easy to use,5,Easy to use. In fact I use it in the shower. It can get way back to my wisdom teeth. A little signal lets me know when to work on another quadrant of teeth. It doesn't take up too much room in the bathroom. It's what my teeth and gums need for a healthy mouth.,55

1803,Exactly what I wanted.,5,The timer feature is nice. Lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant of teeth. If you want to devote 30 seconds to each quad. Like I do.,31

1808,Buyer beware,1,"This tooth brush does not work, it does not keep a charge and when it is charged it runs really slow? I'm so disappointed because it's been 3 months so I can't return it",34
1809,Terrible,1,"This is the worst electric toothbrush I’ve ever had. Super loud and painful. The NY Times “Wirecutter” site said this was the best electric toothbrush to purchase 2021, which is really strange. I’ve paid less for better e toothbrushes that didn’t wake my fiancé up from the other room.",49
1810,Average,3,"Definitely liked my last Oral B brush better… this one is heavier, bulkier and when fully charged way to strong",20
1811,Great product,5,"Works like wonder bread...lol.
My teeth and gums LOVE IT !",11
1812,Great for first time electric user,5,First time using an electric toothbrush and I wasn't sure what to expect. This one was super easy to use and leaves my teeth feeling really clean! Only complaint is that the base gets pretty scummy even if I rinse off the whole thing. Lots of drool.,47
1813,IT HAS ONLY ONE SPEED. AND IT IS EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE.,1,"This product has a single speed. And it's too aggressive.
I don't know why they don't clearly state it loud and clear",22
1814,love it,5,my teeth,2
1815,do I grabbed this one knowing how great these perform,5,"Already had another Oral-B 2 speed unit that was getting old, do I grabbed this one knowing how great these perform. Already had an 8 pack of floss action heads that I used. For the money, this is the way to go.",42
1816,Not too good,2,I honestly expected more from this brush. It does a decent job it just doesn’t do anything that is advertised for,21
1817,Timer,4,"My teeth feel incredible - glad I got this.

Only gripe: the timer is inaccurate, and if you don't believe me - time it yourself.",25
1818,Amazing toothbrush!,5,"battery lasts for over 5 day for me! I went on a trip and didn't have to charge it once. Now, I never bring my charger with me. It is powerful and does the job! I recommend purchasing this toothbrush!",40

1835,This thing is great.,5,I didn’t know how superior this electric toothbrush is compared to manual. Orders of magnitude better. I’ve only owned this one but I’ll not be going back to ordinary one ever.,31
1836,Very noisy,1,"It's very noisy, it seems like you brush your teeth with a drill. Returned",14
1837,Battery dead in less than six months.,1,I have used Oral b for years and swear by them. My last one was still running pretty strong after 6 years. This one’s battery completely died in less than six months. It will not keep a charge long enough for 10 seconds of brushing. I will update this review if I ever get to talk with customer service.,59
1838,Great Electric Toothbrush,5,"My old Oral-B toothbrush died recently and I needed a replacement. This toothbrush has gone above and beyond in helping my mouth feel clean and refreshed. The 2-minute timer is useful in ensuring I brush enough, and it has great power. I would highly recommend this.",46
1839,Battery,3,. Battery is the problem. When it dies it takes too long to recharge. Have to Shell out a lit more money for one that doesn't have this inconvenience.,29

1852,Great toothbrush!,5,Best toothbrush I’ve ever had! First electric toothbrush I’ve used. Absolutely love it and will not go back to a manual. Feels as though I’ve been to the hygienist after every brush!,32
1853,Advantage of Oral-B Black Pro electric toothbrush,5,My husband and I have been very happy with this toothbrush—the circular motion is great and seems to be very good at removing particles between the teeth. We also like the circular motion near the gums which feels better than up and down vibrations.,44
1854,Es el PRO 1000 !,5,"Bien empacado. El producto es muy bueno. Se demora en cargar, y no encontré la función de temporizador",18

1858,Rotary is Way to Go.,5,"Rotary brush movement is the way to go, that plus the variety of speed selections keeps it from those crazy sensations on your teeth or gums that some of us can't stand. Your Dentist's cleaning device is rotary, yours should be too.",42

1860,LOVE IT!,5,Best toothbrush I have ever had!! it leaves my teeth very clean and they even seem whiter!,17
1861,Needs to be cleaned well,4,"Does a great job of cleaning teeth. Needs to be cleaned on a regular basis though. Toothpaste residue tends to build up in the brush shaft, as well as under the oscillating metal post. I make sure to remove the head and run under hot water, as well as turning the base upside down and giving it a good shake nightly to keep the build up down. Also no pressure sensor. Otherwise brushes teeth great.",75
1862,Painful,4,I like this toothbrush a lot but god it makes my teeth hurt. I'm very careful not to press hard but it makes them hurt deep inside for quite some time like 10 hours.,34
1863,I really like this toothbrush,5,"I really like this toothbrush. Definitely works better than a conventional toothbrush. The vibration every thirty seconds is nice and lets you know to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. Waterproof, reliable, works great.",37
1864,Be Aware This Item Is Not Refundable!!,1,I received this item damaged but I can't return it because it is not REFUNDABLE!!,15

1867,Wow,5,"Got rid of the black stains behind my bottom front teeth after a week of use. I cannot recommend this product enough. Anyone who's still using ""analog"" toothbrushes needs to try out one of these.",35
1868,Shakes your BRAIN!,3,Be sure your teeth are tight to your gums 'cause this thing will knock them out of your mouth .. it's that strong. I used another more expensive brand and now wish I would have bought it despite the higher price!,41
1869,... is my first electric toothbrush and so far so good. The charge lasts about a week and use ...,4,"This is my first electric toothbrush and so far so good. The charge lasts about a week and use is pretty straight forward.

I gave it four stars because the pressure sensor doesn't seem sensitive at all, and the original brush set up seems harsh.. I ordered sensitive brush heads to alleviate this.",53
1870,Amazing,5,Absolutely happy with my purchase,5
1871,Cleanest teefies ever!,5,"Best electric toothbrush for the value! My dentist was so impressed, and we all know how difficult THAT can be, oof. Love the timer function too! My boyfriend was jealous so I got him one too, and he really loves it as well! (Even though i bought him a pink one HAHA). No regrets. Easy to replace brush heads too.",60
1872,Solid Electric Toothbrush,5,"Just upgraded from a standard toothbrush and I can feel the difference. Although my gums were slightly bleeding the first few days. Afterwards, I can feel the difference in the cleaning of my teeth. The timer system really helps me keep track of how long I am brushing each quadrant of my teeth.",53
1873,Works great,5,Works really well for cleaning teeth and the function that doesn’t allow you to press too hard is great since I tend to push too hard myself. Definitely worth the spend!,31
1874,"Works really well, you will notice the difference",5,"I didnt think the difference from a regular toothbrush to this would have been so much, but wow! Wont be able to go back now.",25
1875,Mouth feels so clean!,5,"First electric toothbrush I have purchased and tried, and definitely will not be going back to the standard tooth brush. The circular tooth brush head is the perfect size to effectively clean within and between your teeth. I can definitely notice a difference in the cleanliness of teeth and notice my teeth have become whiter since using this toothbrush.",59
1876,Good brush. Replacement heads can be better,3,The brush is overall good. The toothbrush head which comes with the brush will last you 3 4 weeks. But the replacements you order will only last you about 1 2 weeks. So that u order more of it. Subtle scam in a way.,44
1877,Oral-B Toothbrush,1,"I ordered this toothbrush because my Sonicare finally gave out. I did my research and this was by far had the best reviews. . Well, after using it for about 2-4 brushes it's not even turning now which means I bought a toothbrush that worked for a a few brushes and now it's either going in the trash or will try to attempt to see if I can write them for my money back. DON'T BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH!",78

1882,Wonderful,5,That it does not have a brush cover,8
1883,Good toothbrush,5,It's a good non expensive electric toothbrush. Of you have a Costco or BJ's membership you can also get replacement heads for a good price.,25
1884,Stop working with in a month,1,I bought this toothbrush in December 23 and less than a month it stop Working. It has been charging for 3 days so far and it wouldn’t turn on. I would not recommend this product,35
1885,Although this is better than a manual tooth brush - I would opt ...,3,"Although this is better than a manual tooth brush - I would opt for the 4000 instead of this one - For a little more the 4000 has more power, more features, and lasts up to a week in case you want to take the unit on vacation with you.",50
1886,Best Electric Toothbrush!,5,"Its so easy for a first timer. It easy on your gums, teeth and the automatic timer functions lets you know to slow down when you are pressing too hard on the teeth. Its the Best Buy.",37
1887,Tooth Brush,5,Great Product ----- Great Service,5
1888,Why did I wait so long to buy this!!,5,"My dentist suggested I start using an electrical toothbrush to help with my receding gum line and that it needed to be something that went in circular motions to pull the gums up since apparently I tend to brush side to side. Whoops! I researched and found the Oral B Pro 1000 to be exactly what I needed for a reasonable price.

Guess what? It was!! I have never felt my teeth cleaner and my gums more healthy than after a couple of weeks of using this toothbrush. I feel like I have been to the dentist everyday.

Features I love include the pulse timer to let you know when to switch to another section of your mouth. Let's face it...unless you are wide awake in the morning you probably get in there to get the job done but maybe not hit every spot. This feature helps with that! I also enjoy that it let's me know with a blinking light when to plug it in.

I haven't found a con yet and I will never go back to a regular brush. So if you are on the fence about spending the money, take note...it's worth every dollar!",198
1889,squeeky clean teeth!!!,5,"Super clean teeth, they will squeek!",6
1890,Oral-B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush,5,"Excellent is all I can say. The first time I used the Oral-B Pro 1000 Electric Toothbrush my teeth felt great. So clean, that I know I will never use a manual toothbrush again.",34

Would have been 5 stars but I do not like the ""pauses"" that happen to alert you to change brushing zone. The battery life is excellent!",50
1895,... have had the toothbrush since Oct and I still love it. I research a lot and take reviews ...,4,I have had the toothbrush since Oct and I still love it. I research a lot and take reviews into consideration. This toothbrush does the trick and my teeth feel so smooth & clean after. I brush recommend two minutes. Only gave 4 stars because of the battery lasting one wk. Not a big deal at all but would be nice to last longer,64
1896,My teeth have never felt so clean!,5,This is my first electric toothbrush and I am impressed with how clean my teeth feel. I haven’t had it long but so far so good.,26

1899,Love it!!,5,Works so much better than the battery operated ones.,9
1900,Well worth the price!,4,"Pros:
- Excellent quality brushing, similar to dental office visit
- Vibrations every 30 seconds tell me to switch mouth quadrants
- Rechargeable battery lasts about 10 days

Cons:
- Recharging takes a while -- I like to use this on a full charge until it blinks RED to recharge. I end up using a manual toothbrush once every 10 or so days.",63
1901,Works great,5,Awesome toothbrush,2
1902,Charge problem,1,I bought this almost 3 weeks ago. After a week or so i have been having to charge it almost every other day. I am really disappointed from this product. I bought this because it had an amazing reviews. But really disappointed. I don’t even know if I can return this item. ☹️,53
1903,Reliable,5,We love our toothbrushes! The charge holds for two weeks. We love the clean feeling of our teeth after using this. We are both excited that this tootbrush prevents us from brushing too hard!,34
1904,Super effective cleaning,5,I was skeptical about the effectiveness of these types of toothbrushes and so was surprised as to how good the Oral B Pro works. Easy to use and the results are great. My teeth have never been as clean or white as they are after using this brush even using regular toothpaste.,52
1905,Love this,5,Great toothbrush,2
1906,Bad,1,Don’t buy. First one came broken sent it back for replacement and that one was broken too,17

1914,Best toothbrush EVER!!!,5,Exceeded expectations. Very powerful and charge lasts a long time. Won’t be using any other toothbrushes.,16
1915,Loud mouth,3,It does a good job but is so noisy I hate to use it.,14
1916,An (almost) perfect toothbrush for the price,4,"I bought this toothbrush to replace my old battery-powered electric toothbrush. The difference between those are night and day, and I really love this product, especially the internal rechargeable battery. My old toothbrush would be less powerful depending on the battery's charge so technically, if you wanted it to be efficient, you had to replace it every 3 days. This one works with the same power no matter the battery charge which was my main reason to purchase this product. There are, however, 2 cons with this that make me dock a star from the product... One, the charging takes forever. If I use my toothbrush for 2 minutes, it takes at least 30 to recharge that amount. Imagine how long it would take if I drain the entire battery. The second one is the annoying buzzer to signal 30 second intervals. Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea; however, what if I want to brush for longer or shorter than that? I wish there was a way to turn that off. Other than that, this is the perfect toothbrush for a great price.",185
1917,Perfect product for dental cleaning at home,5,Love it. Well priced and efficient! It takes no time to charge and has lasted me days. The motor is powerful and the battery is long lasting. It arrived very quickly.,31
1918,Died after 2 months,1,This toothbrush has completely died after two months of use. Money down the drain (literally!),15
1919,Noise greatly diminishes brush,3,This is by far the loudest electric toothbrush I’ve ever heard. Enough so that I won’t use it in our closed door master en suite if my significant other is asleep. I’m talking hand mixer loud. I do think it cleans well and I like the timer but honestly can’t get over the noise of it.,56
1920,powerful machine,5,"the original brush is hard, so I replaced it a soft brush. It spins so fast and really does great job cleaning your teeth. You do have to hold it at an angle otherwise it feels like it's scraping your teetn",41
1921,Faulty battery,1,This is my second toothbrush. Bought it to replace my old toothbrush that lasted 5 years before requiring a charge once in 2 weeks. It could last up to 2 weeks previously. The new one has terrible battery life - basically flashing red after every single brush.,47
1922,Four Stars,2,"First, got on 1/18/18 not 1/13/18 when I went to return it, it said I could not 30 days was past. Second, my Dentist said not a good unit for someone with fillings on the front of there teeth.Third, to hard on my gums- they hurt.",46

I used a normal $5 electric toothbrush before that I thought was working well but the Pro 1000 opened my eyes that it really wasn't. This brush gives you a daily just left the dentist feeling,52

1927,so nice! ) and they work great,5,We got two of these (different color bases.... so nice!) and they work great. I got great remarks on my last dental cleaning and I attribute it to my new brush. I love that a two min timer is programmed into it. It's easy to tell when my time is up and after my teeth feel nice and clean.,59
1928,Makes your whole head vibrate,3,I used to used the Phillips sonicare. It finally died after 5 years of use. I though I try oral B. I don’t not like the heavy vibration I feel when it use it. It makes me feel a bit dizzy.,41

1932,Great Elect Tooth Brush,5,"I never imagined I'd buy a $50 dollar toothbrush. However, I'd been using a cheap vibrating toothbrush from wally world that cost about $5 a shot and lasted a couple of months before dying. I really liked the vibrating brush, and when researching brushes I ran across the Oral B Pro 1000 and thought I'd give it a try. I LOVE this toothbrush! I've always been a really good brusher, so I thought. Having the timer on this baby showed me I was often rushing my brushing. I love that it signals you every 30 seconds to change quadrant by alternating the vibration. If you would have asked me about a relatively expensive electric toothbrush a month ago I'd of told you they were a gimmick for kids. Now I'll tell you again, I LOVE this toothbrush. The vibration is wonderful and the rotating head gets in the cracks and crevasses, I am really glad I smartened up and bought this toothbrush. The battery charge holds great. I travel for business and have used the brush for 6 days without a charge and it still kept going. Very impressed, and my teeth are cleaner and my gums feel healthier than ever.",201

1936,All the brush you'll need.,5,"I have used this for about a month and its very compact and does the job. Others may have a few more bells and whistle, but do we really need Bluetooth on a toothbrush?",34

1938,Small footprint on sink counter,3,"Tiny yet powerful, great for travel. Update: 4/6/2019 did not last long before the rechargeable batteries no long worked.",19
1939,Completely unsatisfactory!,1,"I bought this in August 2017 and it stopped working by January 2018. The head vibrates and no longer rotates. My previous Oral B E-toothbrush lasted 3 years.

Now Oral wants ME to pay to ship this junk brush to them along with a letter and a bunch of other garbage for a defective product.",55

1941,You make me feel like a natural woman.,5,"Ok the motor is pretty intense BUT my mouth is so fresh and so clean clean! Love how it makes my teeth feel. Like a good friend, the buzzing lets you know when 30 seconds (I think) has happened so you can switch sides or do what you do.",49

Fantastic.",33
1944,Amazing,5,Amazing! With this i feel like i’m really getting a much deeper cleaning than a manual toothbrush.with the round tip i am able to really get all around my teeth. Whereas with the manual it was a bit harder to brush the interior part of my teeth.,47

1946,works great,5,Electric is the only way to go and this one just keeps going. with one person it will last about a week on a charge. It is nice to not have to pack the charger on shorter trips.,38
1947,battery not good,3,"I think the capacity of this battery is not good, so it must be charged frequently. I am disappointed at this point. To put it simply, my wife's electric toothbrush only charges once after I charge it 4 times. I feel unhappy.",42
1948,"Six months later, not even using every day, charger won't work",1,"It worked as expected for 6 months, not even using every day -- and then it refused to charge in its charging dock. Looking to contact manufacturer now....",28

1951,No brush head cover? Bushleague,1,"Do you like to really get in and grind your teeth like I do? well this is not hitting anywhere near as hard as the sonicare. you might like this if you're the soft bristle type and soft in general. And seriously Oral-B, no brush head cover? Amateur hour apparently.",50
1952,Worth the extra $10,5,Works great very solid construction and the black color is attractive. worth the extra $10,15

Anyways this thing is a great deal and it will leave your mouth feeling Dentist office fresh every use. It also has GREAT battery life.,47

1964,Great find,5,The battery life of this tooth brush is amazing and it’s a great brush with 30 second intervals to let you know when it’s time to change sides.,28
1965,Worst purchase of my life,1,"Broke. Never able to hold a charge. Makes noise, doesn't vibrate. Charged for 22 hours, nothing. Charges for 2 days, nothing. Charged for two weeks, nothing.",26

Con: You do have to hold it to your teeth.",17
1969,"Good product, but battery issue",4,"The product works well as expected. Does a relatively good job of clean up. My only problem is that the standard battery dies too quickly. So I started using Rechargeable battery. If this product could come with a Rechargeable battery with a charger, that will make the product so much better.",51

1971,Low quality battery,1,"In the description of this toothbrush, they say the battery can last for 2 weeks based on using it 2 times a day for 2 minutes.

1976,Awesome spin brush!,5,"Strong brusher! My dentist recommended electrics for years and i finally bought the oral-b 1000. At first it was a bit much, but i quickly got used to the sensation. It fits in all the hard to reach places and gives and awesome clean. The 30 second timer is a nice feature. I need to charge fully about every 7 days as expected.",63
1977,Your teeth will feel great.,5,I love this toothbrush. It's powerful and easy to clean. The battery life isn't as long as the older ones but that's not a big deal compared to the cleaning power you get from it.,35

1981,"Solid toothbrush, as usual from Oral-B",4,"Feels nicer in my hand than my older model which lasted about 15 years. This one feels a bit more powerful and the brush head fits on quite perfect, not loose or too snug. Wish the button was another inch down, but will get used to it.",47

1989,Power does not last long,1,"Initially charge would stay for 2 days. Within 3 to 4 months of purchase, the charge didn't stay even for one time brushing use. I have owned other electric toothbrushes but this is by far the most trouble I had.",40
1990,love it!,5,I never knew how much better toothbrushing could be. (I know that sounds silly -- but it is!) Or how much easier it would be to have an electric toothbrush. My dentist recommended that I get one. I used Cash back points to buy it.,45
1991,Works great and teeth fell much cleaner,4,"Works great and teeth fell much cleaner. Would give it 5 stars if the charger worked on international voltages.
Cannot believe that in 2016 they can't make a dual charger like you find on most other electronic gadgets.",38
1992,Buy it,5,"Love it. Takes a few times to get used to it, but doesn’t take up much space, the vibration to when to switch quadrants of your mouth is easily felt, as well as the 2 minute timer, for when you are done.",42
1993,Great product,5,"We bought this one when our last Oral B started to not hold a charge for very long after many years of use. This one is a perfectly new version. It's powerful, holds a charge for days, and definitely gives you a good, deep cleaning.",45

2002,Battery Sucks!,2,"The battery charge at the beginning lasted two days, since then even after charging it over night, the toothbrush lasts roughly 10 seconds and requires a charge. Even after consecutive charges-it still only lasts 10 seconds per brush. This is a fake Oral-B knockoff. Good luck returning it :)",49
2003,great quality,5,i've had this since october and couldn't be happier with it. the charge lasts a long time and it doesn't take up much space in my bathroom. i also like that it vibrates when you're supposed to switch sides.,39
2004,"Very good, powerful toothbrush",5,"Excellent, powerful electric toothbrush. I had my old Braun for 10 years until it recently gave up the ghost, hopefully this will last as long. I'm not crazy about the little hiccup it gives you every 30 seconds, but I can see how it would be useful.",47
2005,A+,5,Love this product. Gets teeth so clean,7
2006,Woah! Clean clean clean!,5,It’s hard to get used to an electric toothbrush. But my teeth sure are clean! Makes it great that there are different colors for the rings so that we can all distinguish which brush is whose.,36

2020,BROKEN after 3 months,1,I bought this product on Black Friday for $35 thinking I was getting a good deal (it was priced down from $60). It worked well for a few months and during the 3rd month it just stopped charging to the fullest. This happened for a week until it just stopped charging completely. The light still blinks as if it is charging... there is just a major flaw with this product. Don’t buy it.,73
2021,Won't hold a charge,1,"This toothbrush will only stay charged for about 48 hours. It also does not spin very fast and seems to lack power when using it.

2032,Great product,5,Very Happy with toothbrush excellent purchase.,6
2033,Works great. Easy on the teeth.,5,"I got this because for many years I've been brushing my teeth pretty hard, destroying my gums. This gives a very good clean (at least it feels that way) while being easy on my gums. So far, works great.",39

2038,Needs a button more like an iphone,3,"On/Off button is too hard for my disabled wife (Age 47 Brain Aneurysm) to press. Needs a button more like an iphone.

2042,Battery life,1,The toothbrush has been plugged in for 2 days. I’ve had it for 2 days and when I tried using it this morning it stopped working and the red battery sign came up. It’s no good. On the manual it says that the battery life after charging is 7 days. This is incorrect.,53
2043,Oral B spinbrush.,5,Great tooth brush.,3

2052,Great teeth cleaning experience!,5,"This is my first Oral-B toothbrush. The cleaning power of this toothbrush is definitely better than the power of Phillips Sonicare. My teeth feel just like after the deep cleaning at the dentist office. The toothbrush is not as loud as Sonicare. As I read many bad reviews regarding charger/ battery durability issues, I am hoping this product will last.",60
2053,Good Deal for Cleaner Teeth,5,"I've always had horrible dental hygiene. I'm, without a doubt, extremely lazy. Though you still have to brush like normal with this Oral-B, I've noted an extreme difference in how clean my teeth feel after three minutes of using this product, far cleaner than a man-powered toothbrush.

When I use normal toothpaste, it provides a noticeably cleaner look and feel, but when I use my homemade toothpaste, the cleanliness is outstanding.

I still use a regular brush to clean my teeth and gums, and I still floss once a day, but I've noticed far less plaque between my teeth after using this brush.

I can't wait to go to the dentist to see what he says.",116

2058,luv it,4,Nice clean feeling,3
2059,Best toothbrush around,5,I was having some mouth issues and my dentist recommended I buy a new more effective toothbrush. I selected this model and could tell the difference the first day I used it. It is powerful without being painful and what a deep clean! Wouldn't trade it for the world. Strongly recommend.,51

2067,Worthy,5,"Awesome brush, i wish i had that before my wisdom teeth removal. It would have same them for real.",19
2068,"Weak motor, don’t buy",1,This little unit has no torque. I prefer to hold the unit up to my teeth fairly hard. With one pound or less the motor gives out. Waited to long to return.,32
2069,Seemingly lasts forever,5,I've been using this for over two years. That's TWO YEARS! And it works like the day I bought it. I don't know how many heads I've gone through; maybe 20 or so. Love it!,35
2070,Awesome product,5,Does excellent work of cleaning teeth.,6

2081,All Smiles,5,"I have not tried the blue tooth connectivity? I just plug the connection into the electrical outlet just like with anything else, because the plug has two prongs. Call it old fashioned?! I love the idea of getting my teeth cleaned more efficiently and hope the dentist will notice the difference on my next dentist visit coming up soon!",59
2082,Works great,5,I did not want all the bells and whistles of the newer versions. I love my electric toothbrush! I've been using it for almost 6 months now and I've noticed a visible difference in the amount of tartar buildup I have on my teeth...so much less than with my manual toothbrush!,51

2099,Works as advertised,5,Excellent,1
2100,Basic but great,5,It works great,3
2101,Good rechargeable toothbrush,5,This is the second Braun we have purchased. It is compact and has easy to clean brushes.. The second reason for selection of a Braun toothbrush is replacement brush heads are more reasonably priced than Phillips Sonicare.,37
2102,Super Toothbrush,5,Great improvements in this newer model. Even the brushes are better and I was satisfied with the earlier model,19
2103,Black edition! Basic but does its job!,5,This is a basic oral B electric toothbrush without the bells and whistles of the advanced models. It just has a 2 minute timer and pressure sensor (without an indicator light). It has all that I need.,37
2104,Excellent.,5,"Oral-B is the way to go. Ordered this for my daughter & grandson, their first. They love it, and most importantly, they use it. It makes tooth brushing better, and for fun.",32

2106,"Two steps down from a Sonicate, but still feels like a dentist's cleaning",4,This toothbrush has easy functions that buzz every 30 seconds to keep you on track while brushing. The red flashing light is also helpful when it needs to be recharged.,30
2107,Oral-B really is the best!,5,"I love this toothbrush! I switched from Sonicare last month and already see a huge difference in my gum health. I have receding gums and they have steadily improved. The space between the gum line and teeth is noticeably better. I can't wait until my next dental appointment in February to get the dentist's opinion, too. Love it, love that it's made by Braun, a great company.",67
2108,Great brush all around,5,Powerful brush that has a good battery life. I wish the brushes came in firm. But great quality,18
2109,Not worth $50 at all and brushes too hard,2,Brushes entirely too hard. Also comes with bristles that are too stiff. Not worth $50 at all. Found a better electric toothbrush at Walmart for much less.,27
2110,Stopped charging after 5 months of use,2,I ordered this toothbrush less than 5 months ago and it no longer charges properly. It runs at full power for a few seconds then gets really slow / weak. It was great for the few months that it lasted...,40
2111,Great for my daughter,5,Perfect for my eight year olds teeth. She has a small mouth and I was having a hard time reaching the back of teeth with a regular toothbrush. But I love this and has made a great change in her oral hygiene.,42

2115,Great toothbrush!,5,Was looking for an electric toothbrush for my teenage son. He loves it! It comes with a rechargeable battery so never have to worry about it running out of power or the added cost of batteries. Will be purchasing more for the rest of kids and maybe mom and dad too!,51
2116,Terrible charging but Outstanding toothbrushe,4,Wife only complaint is the charging system is way to slow over 24 hours to charge for only 10 uses during one week,23
2117,More Power,5,"More power than the previous Oral B ""500"". Also, this one holds a charge longer",15
2118,Good toothbrush,5,Works just as intended,4
2119,Junk toothbrush,1,"I decided to disregard the reviews because my dentist recommended oral b. Does its job but its cheap, loud & mine keeps intermittently starting & stopping for split seconds during use. Wish I put the money towards a higher end brush.",41
2120,Great electric toothbrush,5,"Both my husband and I have one of these. I thought my teeth were getting clean until I used an electric toothbrush. Does a much better job of cleaning your teeth than a traditional toothbrush.

Kinda wish they had more color options but it is just a toothbrush.",48
2121,so good! I bought this when my $200 electric toothbrush ...,4,"So far, so good! I bought this when my $200 electric toothbrush broke. I didn't want to spend $200 again, so I bought this one. It works well. My only complaint is it doesn't come with a case.",38
2122,Great cleaning job!,5,Im known to get a lot of plaque on my teeth! This has really helped me keep it off!!!,19
2123,This product does not work for travel,1,"How on earth can they sell a product that is supposed to be for travel when it does not automatically come with a charger that works on 220 volts? Use once, now useless. Nowhere in the product information above does it say ""this product does not work in countries with 220v""
Shame.",52

2125,Bought this because I wanted a better clean and actually be excited to brush,5,Bought this because I wanted a better clean and actually be excited to brush.

2126,Works grest,5,Well made and really works well,6
2127,Awesome,5,Awesome,1
2128,No brush head?!,1,Did all my unboxing of the new toothbrush and it didn’t even come with the brush head?! Looked all over at unboxing videos and everything to see if I was losing my mind and mine must have had the only box with no brush in it. Not happy…,48
2129,ok,4,"ok,not bad",2
2130,Pressure sensor doesn’t work,1,I bought this toothbrush because I thought it had a pressure sensor. After a week of use I have been unable to get the sensor to trigger. I’m not convinced it even has one.,34

2136,Christmas gift that was deeply appreciated.,5,"My son requested a tooth brush, and I bought it for him.",12
2137,120 volts only,1,"I cannot really evaluate the product, but I would like to warn. This is a 120 volts compliant device (no 220 volts). It will not work properly elsewhere, except the US. I am giving one star only to draw attention.",40

2139,It is perfect,5,It is perfect,3

2147,That it worked the way I expected,4,It worked good,3
2148,Pricey for a manual toothbrush,1,"I was very excited to try this out. Charged it overnight and found out its defective. Basically a $40 manual.

2149,Best tooth brush,5,"Scrapes all the plaque off your teeth, watch out for your gums though. Best product by far 10/10",18
2150,Brushing the back teeth and gums,4,I like this toothbrush. It brushes the back teeth better than the sonicare that I have and also does a better job of massaging the gums.,26
2151,A great choice for tooth and gum health !,5,"A noticeable improvement in gum & teeth health in 1 week, This amazing brush with a good toothpaste will brighten your smile, remove plaque, and improve gum health with daily use. I am VERY happy I purchased it .",39
2152,Smart Purchase,5,"Very nice toothbrush; however, not surprising at all. This is a good brand that I have been loyal to over the years.",22
2153,Teeth are happy,5,"Replaced an older Oral-B, this is lighter, smaller, and just as loud.
I like the loudness as you can adjust your mouth and make music-like sounds that rival most pop songs today for quality.",34

2162,super toothbrush,5,I had a multi speed oral-b and this single speed is much lighter and does a better jo.,18
2163,Excellent for the price,5,There's no benefit from buying the super expensive toothbrush models. This one works great and is a great price.,19
2164,Cleans well!,5,"I like the fact that you don’t need to charge it for too long to get a long lasting battery. So far it suits me perfectly, and I recommended it to all my family and friends because of its low price and true to its function.",46

2189,This one works great! Love it,5,I had this same toothbrush from 2013 and it finally died. I couldn't get the batter out to save my life so decided it was time to buy a new one since it could not hold a charge anymore. This one works great! Love it.,45

2200,No good after 6 months,1,"After 6 months of use, the toothbrush just stopped working. It will not charge. I look at various YouTube videos to change the battery, but its too complicated.

2201,Feels like a professional cleaning!,5,Love this brush! Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after a cleaning! Definitely recommend for the price!,21
2202,Like having a jackhammer in your mouth,1,"Having used this for a 10 days now I can warn you off by saying It is loud, difficult to maneuver around back teeth and about a subtle as the root canal it purports to alleviate. Yuck. Find something better.",40

2207,"Great Tooth Brush, forget the technology!",4,"Great tooth brush. My wife has the 3000 and the battery last 10 times longer. I will say, paying for all the ""tech"" items in the long run wasn't really worth it. I never use the App and I never use blue tooth.",43
2208,Gross! 🤢,1,"While the original was replaced easily by Amazon for the same reason, these toothbrushes all collect black mold in the head. All 3 of my kids brushes, same thing. Gross!!",30
2209,Cleans my teeth very well,5,This toothbrush works really great and it hold it charge well and it makes your teeth feels like you just left the dentist office.,24
2210,"Good clean, bad longevity",3,"This toothbrush made my teeth really clean, it was the first time I have ever been complimented by the dentist for my teeth. But it only lasted about a year and a half before the motor ran out. My boyfriend has the $20 cheaper version and his has been going strong for 2 years.",54
2211,Crap,1,It stops while using and starts back up and it’s fully charged. This the second one they have sent . The first one would bogg down while brushing.. I just want my money back . Sad product oralB,38

2219,I wish I had bought it sooner,4,"All the dental sites say it doesn't matter if you use a manual or electric toothbrush so I skipped getting an electric one for years. But the first time I used this I felt like I was getting a professional cleaning.

I like that this model had great reviews and beat out the more expensive models on several sites. It also has a variety of toothbrush heads that are compatible with it. And the replacement heads are cheaper than its main competitor.

This is a simple model without a lot of bells and whistles (bells and whistles that have no science behind them). The 2 minute timer gives you four 30 second alerts to prompt you to move to a different area of the mouth. It is loud.",128
2220,Great electric toothbrush,5,No problems or issues with this. It works really well and seemed to make a difference in only one use.,20

2237,Very good!!,5,Perfect!!,1
2238,Works fine,5,"This is fine. No concerns, but no miracles either.",9
2239,"Very rough brush, short battery life",1,"After years of using a sonicare, I decided to give this a try after reading the good reviews. The brushing action is extremely rough and jarring, the brush head fibres are hard, and it needed recharging after less than a week of brushing. Extremely disappointing.",45

2248,Must buy!,5,My husband and I absolutely love our new electric toothbrushes. They make us feel like we just went to the dentist.,21
2249,Nice.,5,Very nice. Does what it's supposed to. Pointless to buy anything fancier. Why on earth do you want your toothbrush to bluetooth to your phone? Absurd.,26
2250,First Electric Toothbrush,5,"I love the timer function, and the toothbrush works great.",10
2251,AWESOME,5,OMG So powerful!,3
2252,Amazing!,5,100x better than spinbrush! I wish i switched over years ago!,11
2253,Good but that's all,4,I feel the vibrations in this brush so I use another more gentle brush with vibrating bristles. If you don't mind some of the harshness of this round head device then it's ok.,33
2254,... the first time I used it but I really like this toothbrush,5,I wasn't expecting the power the first time I used it but I really like this toothbrush. I went away for a few days and did not take it with me. What a difference.,34

2258,Great product!,5,Great product for the money! The regular vibrating electric toothbrush didn’t work for me but this one is great! Excellent cleaning!,21
2259,super comfortable,5,works great i like the 30 second timers so you know when to switch quadrants I honestly wish i'd bought the blue tooth one to help me better schedule brushing since I work grave yard shift and eat at awkward times of the day,44
2260,Love it!,5,This is a great product 👌,6
2261,Great,5,Love it kids,3
2262,VERY BAD PURCHASE.,1,Wish I can give zero star. Very disspoented. Poor battery life. Hurt my gum and make it bleed. Wish I can retuen it but I can't see an option to to return since it's passed the 30 days. Now it's just sitting in my cabinet drawer and I wsted $40 for nothing. So frustrating!,54
2263,Easy to heat up when charging,3,"The effect written on the product is completely unexperienced. I feel that I know this and bought a fake product, which is completely different from the last time I bought it.",31
2264,Wish it was all blackll,5,Other than that,3
2265,Much better than brushing manually,5,"I reluctantly bought this toothbrush because of the rather insistent prodding of my dental hygienist. I thought I was doing a better job brushing by hand than an electric toothbrush would do, but the first electric brushing dissuaded me of that conceit. I'm totally sold and sorry I didn't switch years ago.",52

2267,LIKE IT,5,It works well and does not tickle my gums and lips like the Philips Sonic with the full brush.,19
2268,Nice Tooth Brush,5,"Works great. Fairly quite,it will let you know ever 30 seconds to brush a different part of teeth 3 times and the 4th time let you know your done at 2 minutes.",32
2269,Great rechargeable toothbrush,5,Love this toothbrush. It is a duplicate in my household. Now we can all get ready faster!,17
2270,Black shows everything,4,"Works great! The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because the black toothbrush, with toothpaste residue isn't a good mix. Next time I will just get white.",30
2271,As advertised,5,"I like this model because it doesn't have all the foo-foo options that the expensive models have. I mean c'mon, we're just brushing our teeth....",25
2272,Ineffective,1,"My toothbrush randomly shuts off mid-brushing consistently despite full charge! (Not a 2-minute timer, brush just randomly stops)",18
2273,If I could Give ZERO Stars I would.,1,"The bristles are so rough and the motor operates so rough as well, felt like I was going to break my teeth. In addition the vendor is terrible, been a couple weeks since I returned and still not refund.",39
2274,Great toothbrush with a good price,4,Great toothbrush with a good price. My only concern is that the black part gets a little slippery when wet and tends to slip out of my hand. It cleans my teeth perfectly and I would buy it again but in a different finish.,44
2275,Not good,1,Broke down after 25 days. Had to return. It was rather big in my mouth. Will stick to my Phillips.,20
2276,Works great!,5,"Never thought I would ""love"" a toothbrush, but this one is pretty awesome. This is my 2nd rechargeable toothbrush, with the other one being extremely old, and eventually died. (10yrs old or so) This toothbrush is drastically better then the old one i had. I like that it has the little ""stutter"" at 30sec intervals to tell you when the quadrant is up. The heads fit on securely, and don't make any excessive noises. There are plenty of replacement head options (another benefit over my old one) I decided to just trust Wirecutters research, and didn't really research any other products. They said this was the best rechargeable toothbrush for most people, and since they seem to be on top of things, I just went with it. Glad I did, this one works great, and I have zero complaints. Works great for me, and I'm very happy with it!",149
2277,best electric toothbrush for the money,5,"works great defiantly better then a generic one, well worth it. its also nice that helps you keep track of two minutes.",22
2278,It's a very good buy. I didn't give it 5 stars just ...,4,"Works just as well as their previous versions. It's a very good buy. I didn't give it 5 stars just because I'm ornery and it's not quite as quite as quiet as its previous version. I see no reason to buy the more expensive models unless ""smart"" stuff really turns you on. Purchased bout three months ago.",57
2279,Five Stars,1,"Glad I finally made the switch from a manual toothbrush.

Update: At first the battery was good for multiple brushings. After a month, it won't last for 30 seconds.",29
2280,Black vs. Blue,4,"Lack of pressure sensor in this model, I don't believe the Amazon ad indicated this. I don't feel as though I'm missing much, just a small irk.

The black model just looked cooler.",33

2285,Great brush for the price,4,"It vibrates every thirty seconds which is very helpful! It does feel a little strong, but paying attention as you brush helps you avoid causing damage to the gum.",29

2287,Works better than Sonic Care,5,Its scrubbing action is almost to rough. got a real good result though.,13
2288,Fine toothbrush,4,"The timer seems to come at less than 2 minutes, maybe 30 sec or 1 min. But it gives a good cleaning",22

Only one brush head was included and no holder for brush(es). Price was great compared to higher level models, my fault for not researching further.",44

2294,Amazingly Awesome Toothbrush,5,Best toothbrush I have used. Bought one for each person in our family and we all love it. Deep cleans so well and leaves yoor teeth feeling like you just had your teeth polished at the Dentist.,37
2295,Average Toothbrush,3,"Doesn’t do a whole lot. Just a timer for brushing each section of mouth, other than that it’s just a normal electric toothbrush. Kinda loud and doesn’t have many features for the price.",33
2296,Soooo CLEAN!!!!!,5,Love this toothbrush! Gets my teeth so clean - better than any toothbrush I’ve ever had.,16
2297,Complete waste of money,1,If I could give this toothbrush zero stars.. I would. Tried ordering it twice and both toothbrushes abruptly stopped working within two weeks. One stopped turning on and the second cannot hold a charge for more than 30 seconds no matter how long it is on the charger,48

2300,Don’t buy.. stopped working,1,Stopped working after 2 months. Disappointed. Terrible product.. don’t buy,10
2301,Definitely recommend,5,Great toothbrush. We prefer them over the Sonicare. Our teeth feel cleaner and look cleaner with these.,17
2302,Perfect Toothbrush does exist,5,"Love this toothbrush. Easy use, slim, and looks great!",9
2303,Great Toothbrush,5,Works well on my teeth. Feels like I just came from the dentist after each brushing. The 4 quadrant feature that notifys you where to brush is genius. Lasts 1 week on a single charge. Feels sturdy and has a nice grippy handle. Only downside is the cost of brush heads. Overall worth the money for a better overall brushing expirence and teeth cleaning.,64
2304,Great buy,5,Cleans super well and the slight vibration it gives while timing you is helpful.,14
2305,Love it,5,Charge is long lasting and it’s super easy to clean. I don’t have any rusting issues as I remove the head each time to rinse it out and clean off where the heads attach. Simple quick and easy steps to take if you want a long lasting product (as the manual suggests).,52
2306,GREAT toothbrush,5,The brush head itself is amazing. Stiffer bristles does a great job. Didn't know it worked with bluetooth or had a timer so I haven't used those features.,28
2307,Good basic Oral B,4,Good basic model. Replaced a more expensive that fell into the ocean. Uses same brushes and charger as more expensive one. A 110-230 volt charger would have been nice.,29

2309,Great Product!,4,Great toothbrush. Really deep cleans my teeth,7

2314,Quality electric toothbrush,5,"I like that it can tell you when to switch brushing the different quadrants of your mouth and when your 2 mins is up. My teeth feel so clean afterwards. I didn’t use the brush that came with the device, I bought the ones for sensitive teeth/gums and those have been working great!",53
2315,Gets teeth very clean,4,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He said it gets his teeth way cleaner than a manual. He doesn't use bluetooth or the timer feature.,29
2316,Love this toothbrush!,5,"I ordered this toothbrush almost a year ago. I've used it everyday since, and, it's worked great. I've used other brands of electric toothbrushes in the past and, by far, this one has been the best - both in value, and in functionality. Holds a great charge, and my teeth look and feel great!",54
2317,Loud motor,1,"You get what you pay for. The motor on this sounds very loud, its rotation is no where near what my old Phillips is. Feels cheaply made.",27

2320,Great toothbrush,5,My exboyfriend had a similar toothbrush so I decided to buy one and am so happy I did. It makes brushing so much easier.,24
2321,Works Great,5,Works just as good as the almost identical unit it replaces. Previous model wouldn't hold a charge after 8 years but this model has changed the recharging process and it works much better.,33
2322,Disappointed...Again with an Amazon purchase!!!,1,I wish I didn’t have to give 1 star...worst purchase ever. I worked one month...totally disappointed. Amazon need to remove this seller.,22

2331,Terrible batteries,1,"Performed nicely, but now the batteries won't hold any charge. The product return window has passed, and I'm stuck with this toothbrush that won't turn on for more than a few seconds. Wish there was an option to swap out the batteries.",42
2332,Perfect.,5,Perfect.,1
2333,Does the job,5,"My husband and I really like this product. Does the job, isn't too loud, and we like the little reminders when it's time to change areas of the mouth. Stays charged up well.",33
2334,Easy to use,5,Excellent,1
2335,Disappointed,1,It takes forever to charge. Once fully charged won’t hold. 2 minute timer doesn’t work. Loud.,16
2336,"Great, absolutely love this tooth brush!",5,I will say I’m very disappointed that there is no travel case. 4 of 5 stars,16
2337,"Very, Very Solid Electric Toothbrush Choice",5,"Thinner and lighter than my last model electric toothbrush, this model is great. You will get a strong, thorough cleaning and I highly recommend.",24

2340,Super clean like you can't image,4,"It's very noisy and you have to take the brush head off every time you use it, but WOW the clean is amazing. My hygenist gave my teeth 5 stars after I used this for only 1 month.",38
2341,Worth it,5,I've had this electric toothbrush for three years now and it still works like new. Definity worth getting.,18
2342,Slim design and makes my teeth feel very clean,5,I like how the design is compact and slim. My teeth and gums feel much better using this instead of my cheaper disposable battery powered tooth brush.,27
2343,Great but $29.99 now,3,I love this item but they dropped the price right when it came to my door. :(,17
2344,Good value for money.,5,Cleans teeth efficiently. Excellent product.,5
2345,Oral B is better than the rest,5,Switched back to Oral B after having 2 Waterpik toothbrushes die. The brush offers good rotation to clean each tooth. It feels like I am in the dentist chair each morning getting polished.,33
2346,Battery died in less than three months.,1,"My previous Oral B lasted over seven years, and then the battery life started dying before I got a full brush in. I finally upgraded to a new one, and this one already died! Conveniently just outside the 60 day guarantee window and if course I couldn't return it via Amazon either. Will not be purchasing this brand again, I urge you to do the same.",66
2347,Good for first time,3,"I really like it. Seems like the bare minimum of the electric tooth brushes, but it was my first one, so I’ll definitely upgrade next time. It does not connect to Bluetooth.",32
2348,Pretty loud but otherwise good,3,It's pretty loud,3
2349,110v supply,4,The package arrived in good condition and packaged well. It cleans better and I like the pressure sensor to remind you if you are brushing to hard. The one thing I didn't expect was it is 110v but our power here is 220v. So I have to buy a step down transformer to not damage it.,56
2350,Love it!,5,Teeth feel amazing after this! My dentist recommended when I asked how to do a better job with flossing and brushing. Bought one for each family member. Regular tooth brushes not going to get it done. Invest!,37
2351,Not what it used to be,1,"Very disappointing! I've used an Oral-B Pro toothbrush for years but the quality of the one I received from Amazon is definitely inferior to ones I've had before. First, the brush won't charge properly because the bottom of the brush doesn't fit into the the charger unless I push the handle into the charger and hold it there. Then the charge light in the handle blinks a few times...and quits. Next, the handle itself has a peculiar, unpleasant odor. No matter how many times I rinse and dry it,the smell is still there. I probably should have sent it back, but life is too short to wait in line at the post office until all other alternatives are exhausted. I still had the charger from the 10 yr old (!) toothbrush I was replacing, so I put the new toothbrush on the old charger, and WOO HOO! it fit perfectly, charges like a charm, etc. So I kept the toothbrush after all. Perhaps Oral-B has changed their manufacturing and distribution processes, and the toothbrush I received was just a glitch. In that case I'm happy to give Oral-B and the Amazon vendor the benefit of the doubt. This time...",199
2352,Cleans extremely well,5,"As promised, Braun lives up to its promises. Great quality product. Strong and well built as well. Have dropped it a few times without any damage. Teeth feel awesome after each brush.",32
2353,I love this toothbrush,5,"I love this toothbrush, especially since it has a timer built into it, not just for two minutes, but at 30 second intervals so that you can brush each ""sector"" of your mouth for 30 seconds (it has a guide with the toothbrush illustrating the sectors). It also seems to hold its charge for a long time so if you somehow miss a couple days it will still work. If you're looking for an electric toothbrush for a good price this would be it.",84
2354,Excellent,5,Like alot,2
2355,Inexpensive cuts out sometime but still better then the battery oral B I have been using ...,3,Use it everyday. Inexpensive cuts out sometime but still better then the battery oral B I have been using for years. I might try the sonic car next,28
2356,not a solid product,3,Oral b wont let me register it. a $15.00 coupon came with it for a discount for heads but they wont even let me register it on their website!,29
2357,Highly recommended by my periodontist,5,I have tried other brands and this is by far the best I have owned.,15
2358,it's good if you want the 2nd best.,4,It gets the job done but it's not as good as the Sonicare.,13
2359,Highly recommended,5,Really cleanse each and every teeth. Totally worth the investment,10
2360,Seems much more powerful than my old one. Very satisfied.,5,Just that is performs better than my old one.,9
2361,Christmas gift,4,Bought is a gift for a family member and they seem to enjoy it.,14
2362,Teeth an gum health,4,Love the deep cleaning of this electric toothbrush feels amazing!,10
2363,Oral B Pro 1000 - Good but watch out for Mold!,2,"Update 2/12/18: Health Hazard

You have to be careful with the brush heads. After use mold gets built up inside the heads. Reason for this seems like bad design, Oral B has two holes in the brush head that allow water and moisture inside the brush head thus probably allowing mold to grow inside.

This is truly a great and effective toothbrush. I'm not trying to sound cliche but I'm never going back to a manual toothbrush.

Since I've used this toothbrush I've seen a dramatic whitening. This brush really removes a lot of plaque that a regular manual toothbrush just can't get because it's simply too slow. My smile is whiter better because of this.

I still recommend you get your teeth cleaned by the dentist, but this thing really helps keep your teeth cleaner.

5/5 You will not be disappointed",142
2364,Great Product!,5,"Oral-B Black Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush Powered by Braun

I owned another Oral-B, way more expensive model for about 10 years before the battery died. While I can probably open that one up and replace the battery (there are instructions online and it requires a soldering iron, which I happen to have), I needed a replacement quickly due to taking a trip and wanting to take it along. This model is one speed, which is fine for me since I never used the other speeds on the fancy one. I love the round heads, which is why I ordered this one. I like the smaller charger, which takes up less space, and it also packs easily without taking up much space. So far, this has been an excellent product and it operates exactly as described. This is NOT a paid review -- I bought this on my own for my own use. I would highly recommend this product -- it is also less expensive on Amazon than in the stores.",172
2365,better by far than the base model I had that ...,5,"better by far than the base model I had that just died after 3 years of use. Has 30 second reminder to get all 4 quadrants of your teeth and 2 minute reminder for finish. Smaller base is only about 1/2"" per side bigger than brush handle.",47
2366,Powerhouse toothbrush! For those of us who don't need ...,5,Powerhouse toothbrush! For those of us who don't need all the bells and whistles of the phone apps to tell us how to brush our teeth. This one works and is half the price of what I expected to pay.,40
2367,Great Product,5,This is a quality Oral B product that is reasonably priced. Works as advertised and shipped promptly.,17
2368,Bad.,1,"Started rusting within a month of getting it and now it's no longer being sold, so I can't do anything about it. Crap brand.",24
2369,Worked really well the first few days. It stopped ...,2,Worked really well the first few days. It stopped working all of a sudden after less than a week of use. It shows that it's charging but it doesn't turn on anymore. Guess you get what you pay for,39

Nada util",18

I ended up, just getting another one...",46
2375,Battery life is terrible - don't order,1,"Toothbrush was fine for 3 months, then the battery died and it won't charge. I see this happened to other folks based on their reviews, so I'm really annoyed that I bought this in the first place. I never write reviews, but this annoyed me enough to do it. Don't buy!",51
2376,Excelente función,5,"Muy eficiente, en comparación con los cepillos cotidianos este es una excelente elección",13
2377,Decent toothbrush,5,My last toothbrush got stolen this is an acceptable replacement battery life is decent,14
2378,It’s good,4,"I like it! Not quite as quiet and smooth as sonicare but definitely does a good job. I wish it had an automatic timed off so you know you’ve brushed for the appropriate time, this just keeps going. Is it supposed to shut off? I don’t know.",47
2379,Very clean,4,"My 1st electric toothbrush seems to clean my teeth very well, sometimes to much and can hurt my gums. Otherwise very happy with it.",24
2380,Highly recommend,5,Teeth feel really clean,4
2381,Loud but it works and the price is good,3,"Works well. Like the price. Other reviewers are correct, it's very loud. I don't like that part but I didn't want to spend more on another electric toothbrush right now so it serves the purpose. If you can stand the noise you'll be fine.",44
2382,Love my toothbrush,5,"Love my toothbrush. Charge lasts a long time. I forgot my charger on a camping trip and it lasted the entire weekend. I like the larger brush heads you can buy for this tho, the ones with a stationary brush and a spinning brush together.",45
2383,Oral B pro 1000,5,Love the timer function on the oral B pro 1000.,10
2384,Sounds Terrible,1,I bought 2. They sound like a low grinder machine. I do not believe they work as well as our Sonicare. Went back to our old faithful.,27
2385,Simple but effective,5,No bells and whistles but it works well. Not too expensive but those brush heads are pricey (check the red bullseye store).,22
2386,My teeth feel clean when I'm done brushing them,5,"My last toothbrush was an Oral B and I had it for years and years. That is why I purchased the same kind.
I get many years of good toothbrushing out of it.",33

2398,Great toothbrush but so loud,4,I got this toothbrush as recommended by my dentist. It's a great toothbrush and love the timer function but it is so loud. If it wasn't for how loud it is I'd give it five stars.,36
2399,Works Great... I think...,5,I just wanted a replacement Oral B toothbrush after the one I had for 8 years finally gave out. I was not disappointed.,23
2400,Definitely worth the cost,4,"I used this for a few days before i had to recharge it.
Seam to work great on my teeth
Definitely a great buy",24
2401,NO BRUSH HOLDER INCLUDED? REALLY?!!,3,"This is the first electric toothbrush I've ever owned that doesn't come with a brush head holder. I bought 2 for Christmas presents and was wondering where the heck do I keep the brush head. I consulted the manual that came with the product and it showed it on the cover, so I went rummaging through my recyclable bin to try to find it in the discarded box, but, nope - no holder with this model. So how much could it possible cost this company to include a cheesy little plastic part that makes using my toothbrush so much more convenient? Is it really worth the price of a dissatisfied customer? So, if you are single and the only user of this item, no problem. If you are a couple, you'll have to figure out where to store your brush heads or buy another brand that includes it. I'm VERY disappointed in this. By the way, the brush seems to work fine.",162
2402,Does an excellent cleaning job at a great price!,5,Does an excellent cleaning job at a great price! Doesn't have a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles. Wish it was available in more colors so our family members could personalize.,31

2406,Does the job,5,It does the job. It isn't exactly what I expected because I feel like my teeth could feel cleaner. I am going to attempt to purchase different bristles to see if it works better,34
2407,Awesome,5,The work perfectly with my Sonicare. Definitely recommend it.,9

2411,Original replacement,5,Tried several cheaper fake ones. But the quality of the original cannot be beat. This is the one to buy. Don't waste money on the cheap alternative,27
2412,The motor stops at moments.,3,"I read the reviews and hoped for the best but, I noticed that the motor stops while brushing - ALOT. At first, I thought it was the amount of pressure I used while brushing but I noticed that the motor stops while I am just hover over my teeth. I keep the toothbrush on the charger .. I am not sure what the problem may be.",66
2413,They are better that my old rechargeable brushes,5,My old toothbrush broke a month ago and I was using a battery operated oral b until I received the Pro 1000. These Pro 1000 toothbrushes really do an outstanding job. They are better that my old rechargeable brushes. Very happy with them.,43
2414,So far so good,5,"So far, I’ve had it for 3 months. 4 people in my home use it 2x a day and we have had zero issues with battery charge or reliability.",29
2415,Worst purchase I’ve ever made!,1,"Nothing but a glorified battery powered toothbrush. The brush head comes off easily and feels loose while brushing. Also, there’s no toothbrush cap/cover. Very disappointed in this purchase.",28
2416,It is very noisy! Sounds like a train in my mouth!,3,"I like the spinning head, so far it keeps a charge for a while",14
2417,Brush action too strong,3,"Although I appreciate the ability to recharge the toothbrush, I don't appreciate how strong the brush action is. I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten one with variable speeds.",31
2418,Clean Happy Teeth,5,This is my first experience with an electronic tooth brush and I will never go back. My teeth feel so much cleaner. The toothbrush also has a little tooth brushing timer in it and vibrates when the allotted tooth brushing time is up.,43
2419,Yay,5,"Upgrading to this from a regular toothbrush is a massive difference. There is NO fuzz on my teeth anymore at all and I only brush once a day. A pleasurable brushing experience, I recommend giving this to people who don't brush well",42

2423,Good product. as described and fast delivery,5,Good product. as described and fast delivery. I paid the price of a lower quality one for this one and that what make it good. It does not worst the full price in my opinion.,35
2424,Switched from a regular tooth brush to this,5,I’ve never considered purchasing a nice electric tooth brush until my dentist told me that I am brushing too hard when I use a regular tooth brush. This was the best $40 I have spent! My teeth feel extremely clean and I know that my gums aren’t being damaged from my brushing.,52
2425,Great,4,"I like the oralb family of powered toothbrushes. This 1 replaced the 9000 series and seems to function just as good, and uses the same heads.",26
2426,Another quality Oral-B product!,5,"I love this toothbrush. Don’t know why I fought my dentists suggestion for so long. Leaves my teeth feeling super clean. And the price was a bargain, too.",28
2427,Not good for sensitive teeth or gums.,2,Simple and well-made but it's absurdly overpowered and fast - I feel like I'm using a powertool on my teeth.,20
2428,Noticeable Improvement to Dental Health,5,Exceptionally clean feeling after every use. Saw significant improvements in gum health as well. Timer function ensures consistent brush times for all sections of your mouth.,26

2430,So loud I thought it was broken,1,"I really wanted to like this, but it is just so loud! I honestly thought it was broken because of loud it was. I will return it and get a different toothbrush.",32

2434,Doesn't work,1,"Worked great for two weeks. Now, if I charge it for 24 hours, it works for about 20 seconds. Compete waste of money.",23
2435,Fast and powerful,5,Great $,2
2436,Typical Oral B electric tooth brush - works well,5,"This toothbrush was inexpensive, works well, but it only works with 110V (I had hoped it worked 100 - 240V but it doesn't.",23
2437,Affordable electric toothbrush,5,Good electric toothbruah that does the job. You can use different Oral-B heads. Timer function is nice.,17
2438,Battery died after two months. Will not charge anymore.,1,The battery died after two months. I was even sure to not let it sit in the charger for extended periods of time. Will change review for new toothbrush.,29
2439,No regrets! Must buy.,5,So happy with this purchase that I bought one for each member of my family! My teeth and gums had never felt better or cleaner! Will never go back to regular toothbrush!!!,32

I recommend this product to everyone who wants clean teeth!,77

My coworker sold me on this one and it really is so much better. Doesn't tickle my nose and I can hold it with two fingers so I know I'm not brushing too hard.",42
2453,4 stars,4,"Works well and charges quickly. Stand could be better and for price paid, I expected more overall performance wise.",19
2454,Would Not Buy,2,This toothbrush is messy and abrasive. I used it for two days and went back to my Sonicare.,18
2455,Styrofoam packaging,2,Toothbrush is probably fine but no more than 2 stars for the completely unnecessary use of styrofoam in the packaging,20
2456,Great value,5,"Love the 30 second and 2 minute timer. Love that this is rechargeable, has charging/battery level indicators, and holds a charge for about 7 days. Better than the battery operated Oral-B toothbrush.",32
2457,Works great,5,Works great,2
2458,Okay toothbrush,4,I've never had an electric toothbrush and I thought this one would be a good first. It is and it does get the job done although the head that came with it is too firm for my liking (bristles too hard) and when its on its very loud and kind of shaky.,52
2459,first time user,4,never used an electric brush before. was pleasantly surprised. cleans my teeth very well.,14
2460,👍🏽,5,👍🏽,1

2463,Not worth it,1,After a year and a half it stopped charging!,9
2464,Dentist like cleaning!!,5,I hate the dentist but want strong healthy teeth. The Oral-B Pro 1000 was an excellent purchase.,17

It is very powerful initially but I got used to it. I can't tell if my mouth feels cleaner or not because I feel like I am already a good brusher.,42
2489,Best tooth brush ever!,5,I should have bought this tooth brush decades ago. I will never ever go back to a manual toothbrush or buy the cheap grocery store battery operated ones ever again. Nice job Oral-B!,33

2500,What the hell,3,Have not had a chance to use this yet instruction manual says it may take 22 hours for a full charge arrives completely dead. Other reviews say this thing doesn’t last past three months we will see.,37
2501,So far so good!,5,"This is the first electric toothbrush I've ever used, and so far it's amazing. It definitely leaves my teeth feeling a lot cleaner after two minutes than just manual brushing, and I love the buzzing timer feature that lets you know when it's time to move on to the next area. The small brush head also makes it very easy to get into that tight area behind your molars and brush all the nooks and crannies that aren't so easy to reach with a manual brush. Plus, no more wondering if you're brushing too hard or for too long, resulting in worn enamel; because of the rotating head, even just lightly touching the brush to your teeth get them clean and so there's no instinctive need to press hard as there was with manual brushes. The only really difficult thing to get used to was not taking the brush out of my mouth to adjust position while using it - because if you do, toothpaste will splatter everywhere.",168
2502,but a great strong toothbrush with an almost tooth cupping brush wasn't ...,5,I am not sure what I was expecting... but a great strong toothbrush with an almost tooth cupping brush wasn't it...

2523,Worked good. Only complaint is the battery life,3,Worked good. Only complaint is the battery life. I feel like it needs to get charged everyday. My sonicare brush needed charging once a week in comparison.,27

2527,Great!,5,"So far this toothbrush is pretty nice! I let it charge for two days and now brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day seeing how long the charge is holding... So far it's been five days. and going strong. The box also comes with coupons to buy replacement heads and it's pretty easy to set up. Hopfully my husband's comes in soon - he's getting jealous of mine!

Only con is that it only comes with one ring color, so when my husband and I will have matching toothbrushes we'll keep on different sides of the sink to differentiate who's is who. Not that big of a deal, but would be nice if they included two or three rings for a multi-person household. Maybe the replacement heads have them I hope?

Edit:We just got his toothbrush in the mail and his ring was a different color! Also someone replied telling me the replacement heads do come with different rings so that's good to know :)",165
2528,Good cleaning!,5,"I got this product yesterday so I haven’t used it for a longer time. But for someone coming from manual brushing, this is amazing. My doctor advised me to get this and I feel my teeth cleaner today morning!",39

2530,Too strong,2,"I always loved oral B products but this Electronic toothbrush brushes too strongly and my gym started to feel uncomfortable, sometimes bleeding while flossing while I never had that problem before using this toothbrush. Recommend to use a lower power toothbrush than this one",44
2531,"Great toothbrush that leaves your teeth feeling super clean. A little noisy, but better than many expensive brushes",5,"It's a little noisier than my previous Braun, but I feel like it does a better job of cleaning my teeth. Would recommend for those that aren't bothered by the sound.",31
2532,It really feels like I am brushing my teeth the best that I ...,5,"Wow, this is such an improvement over the last electric toothbrush I had. It really feels like I am brushing my teeth the best that I can and know it will be so good for my gums also. So glad I got this toothbrush!!",44
2533,It's probably better than what I got,2,"So, I'm giving this a two star review because the battery in this thing is absolute junk. I used this product for two days, in which it worked well, let it charge overnight, and now it won't run any longer than 30 seconds before telling me I need to re-charge it. Makes it super inconvenient to brush my teeth this way. Hope you have better luck than I do!",69

2584,Loud loud loud,2,So so loud!!!!! So hard to use. My husband hates it. Mine (dif brand) is much quieter. Just awfully loud!!,20
2585,"Great toothbrush, great price!",5,"I've tried several electronic brushes for at or around the same price as this one, but the Oral B Pro has got to be the best one of the bunch. It charges quickly, is very easy to clean, and most importantly it delivers a very thorough cleaning of your teeth. If you want a high quality toothbrush for a fair price, this is the one for you.",67
2586,Very functional,5,Much nicer and more usefulthan the Sonic Care I had which was three times the cost. I will buy it again.,21
2587,Cleans teeth !,5,Feels like I walked out of the dentist office every time ! Looking forward to my next appointment to get results.,21
2588,Won’t charge anymore,5,It has stopped charging. I’ve had it for about 6 months now and will no longer charge and I can’t return or get a refund so… unhappy with the purchase,30
2589,Dentist recomended,5,"My dentist recommended this brand to me as this is my first electric toothbrush. I like it so far, easy to use and my teeth feel cleaner than ever.",29
2590,Should have bought this years ago,5,I purchased two of these based on the reviews and am very pleased. We have never used a power brush before and now regret not moving to them sooner!,29
2591,Battery died for good after 6 months.,2,Battery crapped out after 6 months. Refills are prohibively expensive.,10
2592,Good product,5,Nice product,2
2593,Great product!,4,"I really don't know much about electric toothbrushes, but this is amazing for the price! It would be 5 stars, but once every 30 seconds or so it seems to pause momentarily.",32
2594,Wow,5,This little toothbrush is great. It cleans really well and the charge lasts a decent amount of time. Worth the price.,21
2595,Cheap version of the better toothbrush,1,"You get what you pay for! Weak battery, sub par power to brush. Very unhappy with our replacement Oral B electrics.",21
2596,Wonderful,5,I love it's great,4
2597,"Charged, but button will not work.",1,"It's only 2 weeks old, and the push button will not work. It is charged, but useless. I bought it to keep in a second bathroom, and thought I would try a different model than the Phillips Sonicare I normally use (which has been problem free for years). I did like the way it cleaned, but will not buy one every two weeks.",63
2598,You get what you pay for and more!!!,5,Works just as advertised. Long battery life for taking trips and solid construction gives me the confidence to just throw it in with my luggage.,25
2599,Stopped charging,1,Only had for a little over a year and it won’t charge anymore,13
2600,The BEST toothbrush!,5,I have used oral b electric toothbrushes for years. This one is even better for cleaning.,16

2602,Love this and it works great went to the dentist ...,5,Love this and it works great went to the dentist for my cleaning and he said that whatever i have been doing keep doing it so i would highly recommend this.,31
2603,Died twice in two years,1,Poor reliability. List ability to charge and was replaced under warranty. Died second time...not robust.,15
2604,Good Product,5,"Not bad for the price, worked great first time used and it handled my plaque buildup well.",17
2605,I would recommend.,5,"I used the sonic toothbrush for five years and Oral B works much better at cleaning my teeth. The Oral B rotates and cleans around my molars.
What I don’t like is that the Oral B toothbrush does not hold a charge for more than four days.",47
2606,This product didn’t work properly !,1,This product literally broke after 3 moths of use. Would like my money back . This product does not work properly. I charged it after using it because the light would turn red. Until it suddenly just stopped working,39
2607,Fun to Brush With,5,Great value for a great product. My son says he enjoys brushing with this toothbrush. Can't argue with that logic.,20
2608,Don't buy,1,Received this several days ago. The charge lasts about 30 hours. I used another Oral B chargeable toothbrush for several years and I am sorry I disposed of it.,29
2609,Gift,5,Received as gift...works great!,4
2610,Dentist recommended,5,Dentist recommended this toothbrush and we love it.,8

2615,Cleans well,5,The best electeic toothbrush I have used. It was recommended by my dental hygienist.,14
2616,... the tiny round brush - does seem to work good,4,Wish it had a normal toothbrush shaped head its been months and im still not used to the tiny round brush - does seem to work good tho,28
2617,I really like this toothbrush,4,"I really like this toothbrush, except for the cross action head. When I used it, my gums hurt so bad I had to put some ora-gel on them so I could sleep! I purchased some Oral-B sensitive brush heads and they work great. The toothbrush is attractive and I think it rotates quite well. It lets you know at 30 second intervals to move onto the next area of your mouth. I didn't think I'd like this feature but it actually seems to make brushing go faster! There are two cons. First, the models should offer different brush head options so you don't waste money on brush heads you won't use. Second, the charging stand should hold the toothbrush more firmly. It just sits on the charger and can easily be knocked off. Overall, you can't go wrong with the Pro 1000. I can't imagine needing all the bella and whistles the much more expensive models have.",157
2618,2 years and going strong,5,Been using for2 years and still working perfect,8
2619,Battery life,4,Battery doesn't last as long as our old Oral B did,11

2621,One of the worst products I have bought at AMAZON,1,"The motor is so weak. I want to return it, but I threw away the box. I am not sure if it was a brand new or broken when I got it. Upset!",33
2622,Nothing so Special about it,3,It’s very fast but doesn’t really deep clean,8

2624,Good buy,5,Works well cheaper then Walmart at this time.,8

2631,Excellent toothbrush!,5,I had a Sonicare toothbrush I bought around 6 years ago and it was more expensive and ended up dying. This Oral-B that I ordered was much less expensive and so far feels like a better quality toothbrush. I especially like the sensor that pauses the toothbrush if you're pushing too hard.,52
2632,Like the timer function,5,Great brush for knowing how long you should be brushing for.,11
2633,This product is amazing! I don’t have any complaints other than the ...,4,"This product is amazing! I don’t have any complaints other than the noise level.

2634,The Timer Is off,4,"It gets all the right spots, but I don't if it was just my tooth brush or not, but the timer function is off. I Like the bluetooth setting even though I rarely use it.",35
2635,Good electric brush,5,"Got this during a Black Friday deal. I see people complaining about rust but I think to fix that problem you would just need to remove the brush head and wipe the metal part dry after use. Can take a few seconds more to do but better than having rust form, so far it’s working well",56
2636,Really cleans my teeth!,5,I had an old oral B electric toothbrush that started to go on and off on its own so I decided to replace it. This one is super fast and really cleans my teeth. I only have it a while so not sure how long it will last.,48
2637,It’s worth it,4,Bluetooth? I switched to be more sensitive on my gums and it does that but I wouldn’t call it a deep clean. The timer function however I like.,28
2638,Great!,5,"Perfect cleaning, easy to use.",5
2639,Buy a Quip,1,It much louder than my Sonicare. I'm going to buy a Quip to replace this one. Too bad I can't send it back or I would.,26

2641,I love brushing my teeth now!,5,I love brushing my teeth now! The built-in timer helps to make sure not to cut any of my teeth short of their fair share of gentle scrubbing. The semi-wireless charging is convenient and almost hassle-free.,36

2643,Highly recommended,5,I love oral-b products,4
2644,Awesome toothbrush,5,Your teeth will feel much cleaner than a manual toothbrush. Like the timer function shakes when you should move to the next quadrant of teeth,25

2646,Shouldn't be advertised with a pressure sensor,1,"Either I got a defective unit, or a person cannot reasonably tell when the pressure sensor is activated. It feels no different.",22
2647,Very pleased.,5,Going on regular use now for 3 months and it does a great job. My wife liked how well it was working for me that she ordered one for herself this past week.,33
2648,"Great product, overall",4,"Great product, overall. However, the on/off button is difficult to feel without taking the toothbrush out of your mouth and spraying toothpaste everywhere.",23
2649,Great,5,Love this! It does everything as stated. Would purchase again.,10
2650,Super clean teeth with little work,5,"Other than being loud, it cleans like you're sitting in the dentist's office!",13

2657,Great toothbrush,5,"A little noisy but does get my teeth clean. Definitely easier to clean my back teeth now, I've always had trouble getting a toothbrush way in the back to reach my molars, this brush allows me to get all the way to back and clean them.",46
2658,Stronger than I expected.,4,Fist few days have been good. Stronger than I thought it would be. Time will tell how well the battery holds up.,22

2660,I love it. Feels like the brush that they use ...,5,I love it. Feels like the brush that they use in the dentist office. So much more comfortable than the Sonic Care. Teeth feel cleaner than with Sonic Care. Great price as well.,33
2661,Oral B Toothbrush,5,"I love this toothbrush, just replaced my original after about 20 years. does a great job.",16
2662,Do more research before buying,1,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas. It won't stay charged long enough to do much. I feel I wasted my money and /or got a dud. On an upnote, she enjoyed the feeling of a deep clean once. ONCE.",40
2663,and have a great combination!,5,"I bought this to replace my 8 year old Oral-B spin brush. It is slimmer, and more powerful than the old one. I replaced the brush head with a Dual Clean version, and have a great combination!",37

2679,Works good,4,This brush works good.,4
2680,NO TIMER,1,I got this for my daughter for one reason and one reason only.... the two minute timer. The timer on this toothbrush does NOT turn off after 2 minutes. Very unhappy with this product and the advertised “features” it was suppose to come with.,44
2681,Easy to use and helpful to teach tough spots with my TMJ,5,Great tool. I have TMJ and difficulty brushing areas at the molars. The small head on this spin brush get the tough to reach spots.,25

2683,Cheap and works well.,5,I've had this a few days and it works very well so far. I've never tried any electric toothbrush brand other than Braun but so far I'm pleased with the results.,31
2684,It's OK. Just average.,3,It works so I can't complain but I do feel the power seems to be a little anemic. I wish I had purchased a higher cost product with more power.,30
2685,Excellent for the price,5,I love the functionality of this brush and the durability of it. It has a good feel in my hands and really does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth!,30

2690,My Hygienist Recommended It,5,My dental hygienist recommended the Oral B Pro 1000 and it is interesting that I can actually tell the difference with this tooth brush compared to my old ones almost immediately. Definitely worth buying.,34
2691,Effective and Affordable,5,It does the job...easy to use and maintenance. Affordable,9
2692,Best electric tooth brush I found so far.,5,"The brush makes my teeth feel clean as a dental cleaning. Tooth brush does not irritate teeth or gums and the head is a perfect size. The charge on the brush holds up for days, and ithe brush is light weight.",41
2693,Not as nice as my replacement,4,"Works fine, but suggest you get softer brushes.",8
2694,Value for money,4,"Overall good toothbrush however this particular model does not have the led pressure sensor. Basically a little red light at the back that flashes if you press too hard. Rather go for the Pro 1500 and above if you would like the led indicator. The charging dock only supports 110 - 130v so not good for international purchases. Lasts 7 days off a single charge. Comfortable to use, the handle has a decent grip. The indicator for charging and low battery power comes in handy.",85
2695,Awesome,5,"It works great, buy it.....you need it. :<",8
2696,Love this toothbrush,5,Probably one of the best toothbrushes I've experienced. Leaves my teeth feeling awesome.,13

2699,Great Toothbrush,5,So far I love this Toothbrush,6
2700,Effective at a modest price point.,4,Used twice a day for dental hygiene . Found the timer function confusing-was it a stutter because of pressure or was it the timing device? Good power and rotation.,29
2701,Great gift for older parents.,5,So happy with my own had to order one for my mother. She has heart disease and it is super important to make sure you keep your gums clean.,29
2702,Loud!,3,Much louder than I’m used to.,6
2703,Worth it,5,Works as good as expected,5
2704,Better than Sonicare,5,This is better than sonicare. You can buy it without a doubt.,12
2705,Great,5,Great,1
2706,This works really well.,5,Works awesome. Forget about the knockoffs. Get the name brands as they truly do a much better job.,18
2707,It cleans so good,5,"It cleans so well, I love it. Saves time, and cleans as if you brush for 10 min with ordinary brushes.",21
2708,Excellent value,5,"I love this brush. My dentist tried to sell me (at the office) a much more expensive brush with all the ""bells and whistles."" This has everything you need. The timer indicates each 30 second interval so I can be certain I'm brushing long enough. Very powerful. A great clean",50
2709,Good toothbrush compared to most others great.,4,I have truly loved all of my Oral-B toothbrushes of course this was the cheapest of the ones I've ever purchased so I knew it didn't have the slow feature or gentle however I did not expect the speed of it to be that much slower than every other one I've had on normal speed. It was supposed to be rated at same rotation rate but seems to be much slower however works well great for travel which is why I bought it because I have a travel case to keep it in. Will almost always give oral B a great rating because their toothbrushes fit wear no others will in my mouth. However missing some of the features and the reduction in speed for dental cleaning when necessary. I know for future purposes I will save up for the higher end ones buy Oral B big fan of Oral B,151
2710,Loves it,5,Got for hubby for Christmas. He absolutely is pleased and says his teeth feel smoother and cleaner,17
2711,It Works.,5,It works great and doesn't rattle your brains like the Sonic brush I had.,14
2712,Electric toothbrush,5,Excellent toothbrush. Replaced my old one with this one and it is more slender and handles nicely.,17
2713,Excellent.,5,"This is the most powerful toothbrush I have ever used. Powerful, yet gentle. I love it.",16
2714,Major battery issue,2,gotta charge it every 6-8 mins of use,8
2715,Oral B toothbrush,5,Timer function is very useful and cleans teeth very well. Super affordable.,12
2716,Faulty,3,The pressure sensor thing stopped working after a few uses. Still can't get it to function properly,17
2717,Great starter brush.,5,Works perfectly and you can’t beat the price. You can alway buy a more expensive one but it seems to work perfectly fine.,23
2718,Awesome,5,I love it but even more so by a dental hygienist loves it. Great product was exactly as they had advertised,21
2719,I like it,4,"Seems to have a small short or something.
But like it.",11
2720,Better than regular tooth brush in cleaning,5,Wish the timer was more noticable,6
2721,Better than Sonic.,5,I went from a Sonic to this. It feels like its doing a considerably better job.,16
2722,It's comfortable to use and works well,4,"It's comfortable to use and works well. I do not like the 30 second and 2 minute vibration though, I wish I could turn that feature off.",27
2723,Works great!,5,Works great. I love the 30 second prompts to be sure you’re brushing each quadrant of your mouth equally.,19
2724,Best buy ever,5,Feels like your teeth are cleaner than the dentist office,10
2725,Powerful brush gets you teeth squeaky clean!,5,I used the triumph Oral b for over 5 years until it gave out. Replaced it with the pro 1000. This is a powerful brush that gets my teeth squeaky clean and for the price ...you can’t go wrong,39
2726,Mildew/mold inside replacement brush ....,1,"We have three other Oral B toothbrushes just like this one. This particular one keeps getting moldy inside the removable brush. We have always removed the brush after rinsing to let the thing dry out, but that doesn't help at all in this case. I don't know what the problem is...we have tried four different brush replacements and they always turn black inside. Which could technically get into your mouth...so it's really gross. Now that I am pretty sure it's a faulty device, I am contacting the manufacturer today to make sure they know and maybe they will send a replacement for free. I will amend this review to reflect what happens with that.",114
2727,Love the 30 second alarms for a full 2 minute brush . Teeth look whiter after just few days,5,Works great and may be my imagination but teeth whiter after just few days. Feels as clean as a dentist visit,21
2728,Perfect,5,Perfect,1
2729,Love this,5,We love this toothbrush handle. It is a replacement for one we already had that would t keep charge anymore because of urs age. We have used this brand toothbrush for 10+ years.,33

2737,Awesome,5,Very good,2

2744,Charge barely lasts a week,1,"Unlike my prior Braun toothbrush, this barely holds a charge for 1 week-used two times per day. My Phillips toothbrush holds a charge for 3+ weeks. Unfortunately I threw out the packaging, so I cannot return it.",37

2749,Brush function,4,Works great with the exception of it cutting on and off every 30 seconds or so. Not sure if this is normal but bought 3 of them and all are doing the same thing. It’s like a pulsating action that seems like it wants to just stop.,47
2750,SUPER COOL....,5,"for a toothbrush!! :D Looks slick, matches granite counter top and works like only Oral-B can!!",16
2751,Must have,5,This has improved my teeth and gums so much. I wish I had started using this years ago.,18
2752,Great product and great price!,5,I purchased this for my mother and she loves it! it cleans your teeth very well and the battery holds for a quite a long time.

2758,"Works great, no need to use a regular brush.",5,Use this thing daily. Keeps the pearly whites actually white and the breath fresh. I like the timed cycles for regions of my mouth. I truly feel that this brush gets my teeth cleaner than a standard brush.,38
2759,Its fine,4,Small brush head not the best for those of us that like ti use way too much toothpaste.,18
2760,Delivery,1,The package was opened and the brush head was out of the packaging. This was a returned or used product. YUCK!,21
2761,"More Powerful Motor, Longer Battery life",5,So much better than the old model and priced very reasonably. I really like that it has a battery charging indicator now,22
2762,Better than the dentist!,5,This tooth brush really is fantastic. My teeth looked like I had them whitened the first time I used it! Super comfortable and I love the round brush. I love it more than my sonicare,35
2763,:),5,:),1
2764,It works!,5,I love this thing! My whole face vibrates and the timer is a great feature. My teeth feel cleaner and the battery lasts a long time before I have to charge it again.,33
2765,This was a replacement for my Oral-B Electric that I ...,5,This was a replacement for my Oral-B Electric that I have had more than seven years. Until I started using this new one I didn't realize how much slower my old one had become.,34

2769,Great Value,5,"Complete clean in a small elegant brush that is an excellent value. It is much easier to keep clean than the prior electric toothbrush from a different brand that I owned,",31
2770,"I'm very impressed, won't go back to the other type, this cleans super, my pearlys are smooth and sparkly.",5,"I really like the circular brushing motion. For a dozen years I've used the Sonicare, and always thought why try anything else. Well, this Oral B was at an attractive price, the description of how it was better than the others, and the reviews convinced me to try it. The Sonicare head/and body lets residue collect inside, it makes for a breeding ground for yuk ! Always needs to be taken apart after each use and flushed out, it still gets yucky. The Oral B is made totally different, it should stay a lot more sanitary. Just remember this, the head on the Oral B is small and circular, so it gets where others can not, so every little bit of each tooth gets sparkly. You just need to add toothpaste a few times. And guess what, the toothbrush and charger say made in Germany. NICE",146
2771,The Best,5,"I've had an Oral-B for years and the battery wore out. This replacement is much better than my old one ever was.. Smaller, faster and has more features like 30 second timer. Save money and get the black.",38
2772,Bought in March broken in July.,1,I purchased mine in March it now won’t hold a charge and the support window has closed and there is nothing I can do. I feel like I wasted my money.,31

2774,This electric toothbrush stopped working after approximately 6 weeks.,1,This was purchased on May 4 and completely stopped working on June 13. It appears that it was only guaranteed for 30 days so too late to return or exchange. Very unsatisfactory. Previous electric toothbrushes lasted for years.,38
2775,Strong,5,"Does what it's supposed to do.
If you still see this review it's because I'm still using it and hasn't broken.
Strong motor.",23
2776,Not as good as my old Oral-B but for $40 its hard ...,4,"Not as good as my old Oral-B but for $40 its hard to argue. It is not as sealed as the previous version so even after rinsing completely, quite a bit of toothpaste residue leaks onto the charged base.",39
2777,does not hold charge,1,"i bought this less than a month ago, and the brush loses its charge after 1-2 brushing cycles.",18
2778,Does Not Hold Charge,2,Does not hold charge,4

2781,"Nice toothbrush for the money, don't waste your money on the more expensive versions!",5,Nice toothbrush for the money! I have the Oral B that cost over $100 and it is no better than this one my husband bought. Don't waste your money on the other versions. This one works great!,37
2782,Week battery,3,Battery charge does not last very long at all compared to previous model.,13

2785,Still goof after a few months.,5,Have had it for a few months now. Works really well and I've had no issues. Lasts quite a few days on a full charge.,25
2786,Happy with my new Oral-B electric toothbrush,5,"Good price and works better than my old non-3D Oral-B electric toothbrush. This one doesn't have all the new fancy stuff like Blue tooth or whatever, but it cleans teeth really well. And it seems to me that I don't have to recharge it more than once a week.",49
2787,Probably not the best,1,"I don't know why but the battery stopped charging on me, I think it lasted 2 months but I'm not buying another one.",23

2789,Not too expensive for a rechargeable. Replacement brushes are ...,4,Not too expensive for a rechargeable. Replacement brushes are where the cost comes in if you had to change them many times.,22
2790,Easy to use,5,Really like it always wanted one. Easy to use.,9
2791,Good but not great,4,You get what you pay for. It does the job but if you want quality I recommend to find a nicer one maybe a Phillips brand.,26
2792,OralB pro rechargeable,5,I really love this tooth brush. The small brush lets me focus on individual teeth. No batteries it is rechargeable and when you are finish your teeth feel silky. It really is the best tooth brush I've ever owned,39
2793,Don't waste the money,1,"Very cheap.
I've tried two different ones and they both act like the motor Kris stopping for a second every 30 seconds or so.
I've used $9.99 ones from Walmart b4 that are better.",34
2794,Electronic tooth brush,5,"I don't want to change this electronic tooth brush, the best oral b you don't have run your teeth hard cleans every thing.",23
2795,Nice but......,4,Nice unit however the brushes should include a cover. The brushes do not include a cover and bathroom environments can leave something to be desired. Manufacturer should include a cover.,30
2796,Great product!,5,Easy handling and operating! Cleans great!,6
2797,Battery fails after one month,1,"I have been using this twice a day following the manual. In between the uses, it sits plugged in and charging. Now, the battery can't hold enough charge to complete half of a single use.",35

2799,Awesome tooth brush,5,Love it. Very good quality. Long battery life.,8
2800,Not loud.,5,20 years it took for the batt. to die. This is the new one. Much quiter. I wanna brush all day w/ this new one.,25
2801,Good product,5,"This is a good way to improve your brushing habits. First it has a timer that indicates when you should brush another location. I do the front top, then bottom and repeat on the inside just as the instructions indicate. The size of the head fit better and consequently you get to more places that with a typical brush. The handle is comfortable and this product actually motivates me to brush longer and better.
I think I van also say that I just less toothpaste.",85

2809,Excellent,5,I had an oral-b electric toothbrush for 15 years that I bought from a dentist office. I was reluctant to change however when I left the charger at another house I had no choice but to buy another. I did not want to stray away from oral-b quality so I bought one of the new toothbrushes they have. I was pleasantly surprised to find how fast the brush head was and it did a great job cleaning my teeth!,79
2810,Doesn't hold a charge,1,"I bought this to replace my previous electric toothbrush and after one use it needs to be recharged. The description says is stays charged for 14 days, that has never been the case with my new toothbrush.",37

Some reviewers have said that there's goop coming out of the handle and I have never had that problem. The first time I used it, I felt it was LOUD, but you get used to it very quickly. It just sounds and feels loud because it's brushing away inside your mouth.

The replacements are expensive but I have ordered the Sonicare replacement heads, let's see how those work with the Oral B toothbrush!",114

2851,Great product! No complaints!,5,Husband loves it!,3

The motor on the head keeps shutting down. The bristles stop with any kind of pressure. Initially, I thought I was pressing hard but any kind of pressure it tends to stop the spinning.

2938,Great product,5,"I have bought this product before, was just replacing an old one. Still a great toothbrush!",16

2944,Works as advertised,5,It is deep cleaning,4
2945,Clean and Fresh,5,"I have owned other rechargeable toothbrushes with more bells and whistles than this one does exactly what a toothbrush is meant to do -- cleans my teeth. I still get a solid 2 minute brushing, thanks to the 30 second reminder to switch quadrants. What I absolutely love most is the price. For less than $40 and almost three times less than other rechargeable toothbrushes I own, this one actually does a better job.

I have used Braun Sonicare and other Oral-B's but the circular motion of the benefits of using the Oral-B Pro 1000 can be seen and felt. I also like the portability. Easily earned 5 stars.",109

I love that after each use, teeth and mouth feel much cleaner! Only thing is the charging function. Not sure if it's just mine, but after I charge it for a few hours, it somehow runs out of battery within a couple of days, which is inconvenient.",65

2976,Loud and basic but cleans well,3,Replaced a Sonicare with this toothbrush. This toothbrush is clunky and it's as loud as a lawnmower but my teeth feel much cleaner than they ever did with a Sonicare.,30
2977,Good Vibrations,5,"I wish I had known about this brush sooner. It cleans a lot better than the Vitality it's replacing, getting between teeth better and with more power. My gums feel a lot better with this brush.",36
2978,Works great,4,At first it seemed like the battery was not working properly but once i left it to charge for 2 nights it held a good charge.,26
2979,Button was broken,1,Well I liked that it worked....but it wouldn't stop until I I hit it. The button was broken and I had to beat it into submission.,26

2984,A good brush. I love the timer that prompts me ...,5,A good brush. I love the timer that prompts me every 30 seconds to switch sides. The charge lasted me about 10 days which I thought was impressive.,28
2985,Great so far,5,Works great so far. If it lasts as long as my old Oral B I will be surprised.,18
2986,1st one only lasted 5 months,3,I just had to order a 2nd one because it only lasted 5 months. Now it loses its charge after 1 brush. It is a really good tooth brush though.,30

2988,A great investment for your teeth and gums,5,"A great investment for your teeth and gums, hand brushing vs. an automatic toothbrush is a world of difference, your smile and peers will notice within a week.",28
2989,Careful with its durability,1,I liked the product but it would do this thing in which it would abruptly pause from working. I used it for about a month before the rechargeable battery stopped holding a charge. So there's a chance you'll get a faulty one if you buy this cheap of a toothbrush.,50
2990,Does not hold charge,2,It advertises that it will hold a full charge for 7 days (using twice daily) but it does not!!! Only holds charge for a day and a half. Very disappointed!!!,30
2991,reliable but loud,4,great for the price. loud tho. not quiet like others. that's what i don't like about oral b. loud.,19
2992,Works as advertised,5,Possibly the best toothbrush I've ever owned.,7

3010,Powerful,4,It’s almost too powerful but I’m glad it works as my last one went weak.,15
3011,The best way to brush your teeth,5,Wish I had gotten this when I was younger!! Easy to share with my 8 year old with the replacement heads that are different colors.,25
3012,Too powerful for my 14yr old son gums and teeth!,2,Not for sensitive gums and teeth!,6
3013,Great toothbrush!,5,I like this one much better than my original toothbrush. The round head makes it easier to clean each tooth and it scrubs well. The round head is far superior than the Sonicare electric.,34
3014,Easy to use,5,Cleaning,1
3015,good product.,5,good product.. very affordable.. deep cleaning brush... it might be a little too stiff for sensitive teeth. they sell special heads for sensitive teeth..,24

3035,Enjoying my first Electronic Toothbrush,5,First electronics toothbrush. Feel amazing clean and fresh after after each brush. Battery life is great (charge once a week and I brush twice a day). The best thing I like is the timer brushing for each side of my teeth.,41
3036,Hygienist approved,5,My dentist and hygienist think I brush 5 times a day and floss morning noon and night. I wish I had this when I was younger,26
3037,I will not buy a regular tooth brush again 😁😁,5,"I love this product highly recommend it ,the first time I use it I was amazed how my teeth felt 😁",21
3038,Environmentally unfriendly poor battery,2,"Shame on Braun for this deliberately environmentally unfriendly product: Braun sticks consumers with an outrageously poor quality battery that is not replaceable, forcing you to toss the whole appliance in the landfill and buy a new one after about 10 months. My dentist tells me to use Braun and it cleans well. However I've been using this product for over 15 yrs now and have seen a steady downgrading of the built in battery, all the while battery technology has improved sharply. My first one lasted 3+ years. It would be easy to design the product so that you can replace the battery, but no. I'm shopping for a different brand where I don't feel taken for a ride and don't generate needless trash.",124

3047,"Ok brush, LED went out within a few weeks",3,"It's been working fine except for the LED display. Started going bad within the first two weeks. This screen tells you at what percentage of power is left. It was reading funny lines and then now it is blank.

I just recharge it once in a while and it keeps working fine. I like the performance of it, but it would be nice to have the display working. I was going to contact company to see if I could get a replacement or something. Not an easy thing to do. They apparently do not wanting you to call them for support. They may show you support centers if there are any in your area, and there's not, but they sure make it hard to call or chat with anyone.

Oh well, I'll just keep this one and use it until it stops.",142
3048,Timer,5,Liked it,2

3055,Nice,5,Works good,2
3056,Short warranty then it quits working.,1,"Motor quit working on July 13, 2018. Did not last even 1/2 year. Warranty and customer service quit by March and April so I'm guessing they fully realize this product is a dud.

What a waste of money.",38
3057,Very good product.,5,Very light. Compatible with old head model. The charging base in this model is quite small and does not include head stand tips. Top quality simple charging system as manual says.,31
3058,Great value,5,Seems like a solid product/deal for the price but would have been nice if there was an option of a carrying case package.,23

3067,Awesome Toothbrush!,5,"My husband and I were looking to replace our Philips Sonicare toothbrush that ran its course of about five years.

3076,Best toothbrush ever!,5,Absolutely love this toothbrush. Love that it pulses ever 30 seconds so you know just how long to brush your teeth.,21
3077,A bowl shaped base,2,"I have no problem with the toothbrush itself, the base on the other hand, I am not a fan of. It is sort of bowl shaped, so all the grossness you just brushed off your teeth slides right off the brush and pools in the base. I feel like this could have been easily avoided with slightly different design choice.",60
3078,just great,5,love it great tooth brush,5
3079,An only 2 year lifespan toothbrush...,1,"It’s no longer working, I purchased it less than 2 years ago.",12

3103,very good,5,I had the previous Vitality model which was also good but this model is much better.,16
3104,I prefer this rotary brush over the sonic types. Also prefer single-speed like this one.,5,"Very pleased. I bought this to replace an identical 7 year old model with a worn battery. This should easily last another 5-7 years.

Great cleaning, good ergonomics, waterproof. I keep the tiny charger base in the drawer and pull it out once a week. Brush head replacements aren't expensive when purchased in bulk at Costco, our local big-box store.

Personally I prefer single speed models like this one, so I can remove it from my mouth and quickly turn it off during spit/rinse then continue brushing. My wife has a 4-speed and if I use it I have to cycle through all the speeds to do that. If you keep it in your mouth for the duration, it's not an issue. At only 40 bucks it's a great thing.",130
3105,My dentist approves!,5,My dentist says it’s doing a great job! Love this brush!,11

I almost wish I had some before and after pictures to post (then again not, because no one wants to see the inside of another person's mouth. Gross.). The stain and plaque removal prowess of this brush, and the floss action heads, cannot be understated. Even my husband was blown away! My teeth feel so clean! A better brush cannot be had for this price, in my opinion. I almost got a more expensive one, and I'm glad I changed my mind and got this one.
The initial charge took a day. Induction charging is slow. It is comfortable in the hand, the timer pulses are super handy, and I find it helps me brush my teeth more thoroughly. All in all, I would (and probably will for my husband) buy again.",136
3127,Good stuff,5,"I started using an electric toothbrush years ago and will never go back to manual unless I'm desperate. Haha. I had a problem brushing too hard which would wear grooves in my teeth from the repetition. Yes, literally. Plus i have a very small mouth with tightly grouped teeth. The small round head makes life so much easier. And i can clean each tooth surface individually. Between and behind are more important than the top tooth surface. This new design is simpler, cheaper and even more effective. I haven't been to the dentist in years! And don't notice any problems. Ssshhh don't tell. Haha",104
3128,In love,5,"I had recently lost a tooth and decided that changes needed to be made to my brushing because no matter what I did I always felt as though my teeth weren't clean enough. This toothbrush has changed my life! And I'm praying to God that I will never have to lose a tooth again. Especially seeing that I'm now excited to brush my teeth, because now when I brush, I brush with a purpose that I know will be accomplished by this toothbrush.",83
3129,Toothbrush,5,Great tootbrush,2
3130,Pretty much will take the white off from your teeth,5,"Pretty much will take the white off from your teeth. So can't imagine plaque staying. No wonder its so awesome. Charges crazy fast though the light is pretty bright and it kind of freaked me out when I saw lime green flashing coming from under my bathroom door after I laid down to go to sleep. Easy travel as its quite small. Small enough for my 6 year old to white knuckle it hard enough that I had to pry his fingers off because ""My electric was awesomer than his electric."" Overall... 5/5. Feels like a million tiny massage therapists are coming at your gums and teeth.",107
3131,Love it,5,"Love it, easy to use holds it's charge for over a week n I brush thoroughly absolutely love it",19
3132,Oral B Pro toothbrush,5,Couldn't be happier. This toothbrush replaced the one I have had for years. What can I say? It works as it should and does a great job.,27
3133,Failed to work after 90 days,1,The toothbrush worked great for what little time I got to use it. There was a sixty day warranty on the toothbrush which made it 90 days. How sad that a product on the market can only make it for ninety days before failing. Pathetic.,45

3143,Would never go without an Oral B Toothbrush & this one is as good as any I've tried!,5,"I have used Oral-B toothbrushes for about 15 years and never plan to stop. I just love them and they last a long time. I absolutely love this new Oral B Black Pro 1000. It has some upgrades since my last model and it works perfectly. Aside from the new style brush head, my favorite new-to-me feature is the low battery indicator. Before we had our brush sit on the charger plugged in all the time. Now I just plug it in when it actually needs charging. Also still love the 30 second increment indicator for switching spots in my mouth. Had that before, but still love it and would never get a toothbrush without it. Don't hesitate to buy! There are fancier models out there, but this little buddy does more than enough for me.",136

3158,There are better brushes.,2,"Not a smooth brush, rumbles and does not feel quality. I was replacing a broken sonic care which osculated at a much faster rate which gave a better clean and overall feel during usage.",34

3195,Great Alternative to Sonicare,4,"Really nice. I like this brush a lot. I had the Sonicare one - which is a GREAT product. However, it tickled the roof of my mouth so much when I would brush my upper teeth inside that I could barely stand to use it. My thought was that this could pinpoint the tooth easier and I was right. This has resolved the issue and I still get that great 'so fresh' feeling after I brush.",76

I have another Oral B three speed that I use at the normal speed (1st one, fastest) and it's way gentler than this one. It also cleans better. I exchanged my flosser head that was tearing up my gums on this model (thinking maybe it was the head) and put it on my three speed. It wasn't the head, it's the brush.",74

3228,Replaced older one. Still great!,5,"We had our old Oral-B for...well...seems like forever. I'm guessing approaching 10 years, but I'm just guessing. We had 4 people using it and it was to the point that the charge would barely hold across all of us brushing our teeth. One day I dropped it and broke it, so we bought the entry level version of the toothbrush and it was noticeably stronger (i think because the old batter was done for.) I don't think there is a need for the higher end models. The only down side is this one will not hold four brush heads. we are just using our old charger base that can hold four heads. I do see there are holders out there on Amazon and thought about getting one, but we are happy for now.",133
3229,What was I thinking,5,Not sure why I never switched to electric a long time ago. It’s a dentist trip kind of cleaning.,19

3298,Brush head doesn't fit on tightly,2,"Brush head doesn't fit all the way on. Like it doesn't click into place or feel like a secure hold. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a replacement which had the same issue so it's just how it is? Or maybe somehow I got TWO defective units back to back (very unlikely though). Some people say their head ""clicks"" into place and others say theirs doesn't. It's most noticeable when it's on and vibrating, it feels like it might come undone and fall off and I'd much rather prefer it click into place and feel more secure. But instead there is a slight gap at the base :/ Disappointing. Amazon was great about replacing it fast, but don't know if I'll keep it at this rate. Did anyone else have this problem?",134
3299,I love this toothbrush,5,"I hope I had used an electric toothbrush much earlier! But better late than never!!

My boyfriend has a Sonicare brush and this even charges on his charging port! I've had this for 3 months now and I haven't had any issues with the brush or the charge. It's a little loud but that's the only con I can think of.

The reviews are spot on! This is a great toothbrush that leaves your mouth feeling clean. It is well-built, gentle enough and cleens deeply.
Do you need a special mode to brush for longer? I didn't. I just, you know, keep brushing for longer. I didn't need a feedback to let me know it had been more than 2 minutes when this brush already alerts you every 30 seconds.

Do you really need a smart Bluetooth-enabled brush? I didn't. I did not intend to spend twice as much on an electric brush to gain that gimmicky functionality. I probably would've used it once.",114

Needless to say that didn't last more than a few days and i went back to analog brushing. I decided to give it another go with this one. Because the head swivels rather than vibrate, the drool issue was not a problem. THAT alone is worth it. The charging station is water tight and the brush easily seats without falling over. The only downside is that I also like to brush my tongue and this isn't really designed for that, so i kept the old brush in a small shotglass of mouthwash for that purpose. Oh yeah, there is a marked improvement on the overall teeth cleaning.",130

Although I saw the same model Sonicare is being sold on Amazon for $19, I bought this more expensive Oral-B toothbrush because it offered Prime shipping. This thing is a skull rattler.

3684,Fantastic Entry Level Electric Toothbrush,5,"Couldn't be happier with this purchase. As far as electric toothbrushes go this is certainly an entry level model. However, I've noticed a substantial increase in the degree of cleanliness after brushing compared to traditional brushes. Do yourself a favor and buy an electric toothbrush no matter who you are. It could very well save you $1000s in dental work later than the road.

My biggest complaint has to do with battery life. It's by no means ""bad"" but I find myself recharging my brush more than I expected at first. Replacement brushes are reasonably priced and I make sure to change my heads about every two months.",108

4007,Solid purchase- easy to use,4,This is my first time using an electric toothbrush. No complaints but it did take me a few days to get used to it. The design is simple yet sleek.

4041,Great product for the price.,5,I paid 39.99 for this week's before it dropped from 64.99 to 39.99 at all the US retailers. I have noticed that the negative reviews all have a common thread. People are upset that this low cost entry level model does not have the same features as it's several hundred dollar counterparts. Well my Toyota is not exactly like a Ferrari but I got over it. If you want a professional product at a VERY VERY low price than this is the way to go. The best part is dental experts agree with me.,94

4066,Awesome cleaning!,5,Love this! Reminds me of how clean your teeth get when the dentist brushes your teeth.,16
4067,Perfection..Beat my Sonicare by miles!,5,"My husband and I had purchased the Sonicare a while back at Costco and thought that was the greatest thing, until they both started getting a little icky and I considered getting a whole new toothbrush. I'm so glad my Sonicare went sour, b/c this is the best toothbrush ever. The rotating head literally cleans every tooth to perfection and the battery lasts really long. It even beats my icky Sonicare as the internal part where the brush head is received isn't open to the inside of the toothbrush so it doesn't seem like you can get random mold in it. Anyways...don't hesitate and at this price you can get a nice hard travel case too!",116
4068,... several brands and by far this one is the best for your buck,5,I've tried several brands and by far this one is the best for your buck! It's simple and does the job. I bought it December 2017 and it's still going strong! Love it!,33
4069,Good Cleaning,5,It is a cleaner but avoid the area of toothache. It cannot replace floss though.,15

4084,Motor cuts in and out intermittently,1,"This toothbrush sucks. The motor is not even strong enough to lightly brush your teeth. It constantly cuts out when in use, even with a full charge.

4126,Has everything I need,5,"This brush is great, I had an older model but stopped using it and wanted to go back to electric. I'm glad I did, my teeth feel much cleaner and the timer really helps assure proper brush time. I don't need a brush with bluetooth and gps or whatever some other brushes come with... it's a toothbrush! Anyway, it does a way better job cleaning my teeth than a stick with bristles on it. I got the black and it looks great sitting on my counter top. I charge it weekly and the battery holds for a little more than that if I forget. Would definitely recommend.",107

4146,This is my first Oral-B and this is my favorite. At first I wasn't convinced,5,"My first electric toothbrush was a Braun, followed by a Phillips Sonicare. This is my first Oral-B and this is my favorite.

At first I wasn't convinced. This toothbrush moves differently than the others and I wasn't sure it was doing as good of a job. However after using this for a while I have to say I think this does the best job of any I've had.

I tend to build up tartar behind my lower front teeth, and since using the Oral-B this tartar is not visible. I'll see what the dentist says in 3 months when I go for my cleaning. I'm very happy so far.",109

4156,It’s like a rocket ship!,4,"I’ve bought a few cheaper electric toothbrushes but they all seemed to die or have some other issues, so I decided to buy a bit more expensive style. This one works great and I’ve only had to charge it twice in almost a month of having it. I like the 30 second buzz to remind you to switch areas while brushing, too. The only downside is when it’s fully charged it’s a bit too powerful. Maybe it’s perfect for others, but for me the vibration is too strong - almost on the verge of giving me a headache every time I use it. I wish there was a way to pick a lower setting. So overall, I like it best when the battery is dying because it’s not too powerful then. The small tooth brush head makes it easier to reach further back in your mouth or other hard to reach areas. It does a great job though, great buy and would recommend this toothbrush!",165

4571,HARSH new pulsating action! Got the ORAL B VITALITY ACTION brush instead!,2,"I bought this to replace my old Pro 1000 which finally began failing after 13 years, and I hate it! It sounds and feels like a jackhammer, and I truly wonder what it's doing to the glue inside my crowns. It also aggravates any tenderness that I may have from eating acidic food.

Research shows me that nearly all of the modern Oral Bs now have three actions instead of two: oscillating, rotating, and pulsating. The old ones didn't pulsate. So, in hopes that this was the only reason for the difference between my old and new 1000s, I bought the Oral-B Vitality Floss Action brush here on Amazon because it doesn't pulsate.

BINGO! The Vitality brush sounds and feels just like my old Pro 1000. It doesn't have a light, so you don't know when it's recharging nor does it double as a soft nightlight, and it also doesn't alert you every 30 seconds, but the timer does do so at two minutes. So, if this Pro 1000 is too harsh for you, do try the Vitality Floss Action. It also helps to use the original style, plain brush heads instead of the stiffer ones that come with the new Oral Bs, including the Vitality brush.",207

The round brushes are so much easier to get the molars in the back. My dentist has noticed a huge difference. I tend to press hard when I brush which isn't good. This helps me from doing that by shutting down when you put to much pressure. No issues with the battery or the charger. All and all this is a great toothbrush.

4886,Very effective and totally worth it.,5,"I had done a ton of research on which electric toothbrush was the most effective at actually cleaning teeth and being reliable. This is the toothbrush that gets the job done. I thought that the whole bluetooth recording stuff was totally futile for teeth brushing purposes. I love that it vibes every 30 seconds to let you know when to change sections in your mouth. I start with my lower left half from the inside of the teeth to the out, then it vibes and I switch. Then when two minutes are over it has a different vibe to let you know. I keep brushing for about a minute after that, spending 30 seconds on the inside and outside of the front top and bottom teeth (for extra whitening). Beware that some of the generic replacement heads might be a total headache to get remove if youre sharing the toothbrush with someone. I've learned my lesson.",156

4986,"Clean teeth, but battery and noise is not as good as others.",3,"I got this and a Sonic Care for my wife at the same price.
This device has a few day shorter battery life, which is right around 4-5 days... really wish it was longer. I also have the circular brush, which I am not sure I love, it also makes me self conscious of the amount of noise it creates... kind of loud.

I will say I do love how clean my teeth feel, though.",75
